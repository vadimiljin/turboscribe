WEBVTT

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
There's a lot.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So, what's next on our presentation?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Uh, about, uh, one moment about, uh, measurements. So, we can add dollar.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But it works only for US, and maybe Canada customers.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I thought we have the locale selection, don't we? In the account settings, in the session.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I'm not sure.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Wait a few posts a missing measurement units. Uh, is it cubic meters or cubic feet?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yes. Yes, we have, but we have an old problem. Uh, when this, um, parameters just an integers, abstract integers.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And the solver does not… does know nothing about, uh, actual inches, meters, etc.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Yeah, but…

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:24.000
We can add it to the UI without recalculation. Just as an… as a…

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We are measuring trucks in, uh, feeds.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Cosmetic thing, without recalculation.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And then we are measuring load of this truck in abstract units. Uh, so this kind of strange.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Uh, it will bring a problem at some point.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It is… it is, uh… it's how it works right now. That's it.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
This is one.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
For Solver, it doesn't matter. Which measurements it is.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yes, but it should be the same, you need.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yes, we…

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Unless it is the same, it is not meaningful.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
But if it is different, then our optimization engine produced

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
unusable… unusable routes.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The problem is that we have the locale information, the session, and the account settings. We need to output it. We have the data, it's in the session. If you click… Here, it tells you miles and miles per gallon.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Well, we can add these things, but without recalculations, that's it.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah, Bob.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And, uh… But this is… this is all wrong in general. This is wrong, too, really. It's supposed to be…

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Let's written parallel one, please.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Uh… You're supposed to pay your ISO code, you're supposed to pick your ISO code or locale.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Metro contemporial.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:54.000
That was it. I've done it, we pick it based on all that.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I disagree, because locale, uh, show… In the US, uh, it's mild, and…

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Federal system, uh, but in Canada, it's a metric system. So, local is the same English.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Uh…

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
No, um, no, no, no, you… The units… the unit's locale is different from the language. I'm not saying that. Yeah.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Ah, okay, I see. Okay, okay, okay, okay, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see, okay.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Yeah. The language does not change.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Uh, okay.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:40.000
We will add these parameters just for rendering. Uh, and these, uh, setting space also must be changed, of course.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Because it's quite old, and it doesn't make any sense.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Uh…

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So, uh, filters. Was it in the main page, uh, with fixes from, uh, so he and…

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I'm not sure what they did.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
We did a bunch of updates and bug fixes for those filters.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Uh… Since, uh, last call.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I think you should show briefly filters for routes and destinations as well.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Okay, okay. Uh, crowdfilters…

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, I'm here, what?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
See them, Parker? You see the filters?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
You know, I've seen…

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah, it… it would be nice to hear from you any feedback.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
For UI, uh, maybe important filters, or whatever important you think.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I saw inconsistency here, this two matrix, uh, looks nice, and corrected, but in a level above, it was named differently, and it was confusing.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Somebody changed it. This is a company standard. Somebody decided.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
In some screens, I saw them ride the full… the full length.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:41.000
No, it was saying delta… delta distance, or delta time.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Instead of between… and we, uh…

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I believe we are seeing destinations, not stops.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I don't understand. If you want to show it, show it. If not, let's move on.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Let's take a look, we can…

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Why was it? Zeus, uh…

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Uh, this map, uh, doesn't have an backend endpoint yet. Uh, but, uh, the scenarios page, uh, in the location tab.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It's already uses live, um… backend endpoint for staging.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Uh, Igor, can you show it to…

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Uh… what do I need to show? Can you repeat, please?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Uh, can you go on the, uh, higher level? To actual list of scenarios for that… for that optimization.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
This one…

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Yeah, click on locations. Uh, and, uh, activate map, please.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Yeah. Uh, so…

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:29.000
It already uses the backend, uh… endpoint… Please click and show the, um…

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Layers. Yeah. And…

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Clusters… heatmap. And standard, um, layers. They should work all.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Marker, we also added weather. You see the weather layer is back in… it's back in now.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Uh, can you click on the weather, actually?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:58.000
The only… the… Yeah, the only thing I want to provide feedback for the next release, you need to add another arrow here.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You gotta pick a date and a time picker. In the past or in the future.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
For weather.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yeah, because you want to see what the weather's gonna be like in the past or the future, you can't.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Hmm.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
It's pointless otherwise. It's pointless otherwise.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Yeah, it totally makes sense. Uh, we… Uh, true, we have the similar idea, but yeah, we need to implement it a sub.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Okay, um, let me see if David…

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:35.000
we will implement a small timeline beneath this map. If there, uh, whether there is enabled.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.000
then you will see a timeline that matches the… this range of this optimization.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And you will be able to scroll through the dates of these scenarios.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
These are locations. You mean these…

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah, but this… but all these strategic optimization, it is planned for some period of time.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:07.000
When we know this period of time, we can show a timeline to scroll weather through this period.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:23.000
He has a… Correct, great idea. I want to bring something up. We need a preview.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:33.000
We need a preview of the date picker. You know why? Because, go back to scenarios for a second.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000
When you go along and looking at a scenario, you basically want to preview it starting from a specific time, right? I know you did a two-week cycle.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
You need to be able to start looking at it from a specific date.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000
So if this is the date… then… then let's just pretend that this is correct. Let's say this is the date.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:05.000
We're missing a filter, by the way, on start date. That's the… that's… I'm not saying it's a huge problem, but it is a problem. We should definitely… I don't… this is the wrong section, too. The wrong header title.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I feel like this should be called schedule, not route. But anyway, here's the thing.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Okay.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You already have the dates in your own, so technically, when you look at the weather, you could pass the date as an argument already.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
One thing we should put in… We could add it in a month, we don't have to add it right now.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000
In the scenario planner. You know, we have the rules. In the regular route optimization profile is that it…

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
If it's raining, if it's snowing, if it's colder, we can slow down the service time.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So if, in future dates, we really should be slowing down the service time, based on.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Some of these things. Does that make sense?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Yes.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Because you know the weather on the day, because the scheduler's telling you what day it's gonna be on.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
So if you know the weather, then you gotta slow down the service time.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And the travel time.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:28.000
So, you mean on the, uh, on the step when we are creating actual scenarios?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So, when we're picking, uh, the dates, we can grab actual weather.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Um… I forgot the word. We can grab weather for the future and apply slowdown.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Uh, percentages. Uh-huh, I see. Totally makes sense.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yeah. If that's what they configure it, if they enabled it, but yeah.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And, of course, we need to filters for slowdowns here. Uh, for analysis.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Yeah. But again, we don't have to do that right now.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
With the… maybe with the weather flex. I do understand. Mm-hmm.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Maybe in a month. But…

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Can you go back to the map?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
This one…

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah, this one. Uh… Parker, what do you think? What are we missing in metrics?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Is it possible to show, like,

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
If anything.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Or to filter by route names, like, what's not clear to me is…

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.000
like, what week sees are running to say, okay, well, sure, I see it on the map, but I don't understand…

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
necessarily really quickly which ones are which.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That's a good point. So… We gotta output either another… a list of routes here, like a helper list.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Routes. And then, maybe, when you highlight them.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Uh, what…

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
You could… it'll show you the one, or with the eye icon.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Or on hover.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I agree. Also, Volvoa already draw a small. Calendar for such view.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Uh, on the bot, uh, which will be located on the bottom of this map.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So we can, uh, pick actual, uh, date and week. To filter out, and it will be way easier than drop-down filter, I think.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I feel… okay, but you're… we're talking two unrelated things, but one that I feel like I've always seen calendars and, like, the top left or the top right.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So we could potentially… making you a separator here, put the calendar here.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:13.000
When they… and then put the routes list here, and then when they click on a date, the routes list change automatically, and then the map updates, and then you solve through all the problems simultaneously.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I like it. I will draw it.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Yeah.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Alright, correct. Good?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And there will be all the information.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Yeah. And then we can add tooltips as well. We will add tooltips.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
One thing that's not output is

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Obviously.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Of course. Of course.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
like, the actual scenario settings, like…

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's very helpful if you can see

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
what the actual settings were.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
forwards, you know.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It will be here. It will be another.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
stop, as it says, Applied Settings.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Okay.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Uh…

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.000
It's, uh, in progress, uh, right now, uh, maybe, uh, one of the developers will show us some intermediate.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Results, uh, because I saw… It's already yesterday on the call.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Okay.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
With developers.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Uh, which one? I mean? Which developer control.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Sorry? Uh, Manar.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Ah, okay.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Banar, can you show us briefly apply setting stop?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Yeah, okay. One minute, please.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Oops, slotting. I'm not sure.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I was just instant.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It's your local dev environment or staging?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It's dev environment, and I was like… Fixing it, so maybe what…

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Maybe you will show us in a few minutes when you're ready.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
A few minutes. Yeah. Okay.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I have one thing to discuss about strategic plan.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Okay.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
After last…

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Okay…

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Uh, well, give me a moment. Eager, Alexei, we… we show everything which we could for strategic…

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yes.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Okay, if, uh… Okay, okay.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Back a minute, okay?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Can I?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I think Wolver can show us until we're waiting for Manala.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Yeah. Okay, uh, so, uh, I left, uh, last week's discussion. I realized that we are missing one more entity here.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Uh, we choose, and we named it Route Sets. So, a route set is a…

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000
subset of locations that are gonna be visited by the same person.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
It is a set of routes that are gonna be planned for this, uh…

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
cluster of locations.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And as I understood, uh…

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Most of customers want same people to visit the same locations always.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And not allowed to visit, uh…

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
by others. So we need to, uh…

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
explicitly shows these clusters.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Uh, so we, uh…

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:47.000
boots, routes, plant routes together into sets that will be executed by the same person.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
So we had a route sets list.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Uh, where you can see, uh, the, geographically, how many rows in each set.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
How many locations each set, and a few…

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
quality metrics of each route set.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
What do you think?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I understand it after you explained it.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:22.000
it's not immediately clear to me that this is, like, week-to-week routes. So, the one column that you have with 20 routes, I understand that it's a route set.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And there's 20 routes in there.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
It's not… doesn't feel that clear to me. I mean, I get it.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I don't… this isn't… I think that this is a totally different… topic, and I don't think that's related to strategic planner. We explained last week that.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:47.000
How to calculate if it's the same route week over week. The problem was that in one week, the algorithm is calling Route 1.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:55.000
With the same 10 stops, it's going around 1, but then in the second week, it's going around 7, and it's the exact same 10 stops.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
That was the problem. This does not solve that problem.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And you don't have… you don't have any way to see how this routes 1 and Route 7 are related, but they belong to the same route set.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
We do have a way, I explained it. I spent an hour explaining it last time.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Yes, but, but…

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
from UI, we don't show it. Anyway, how they are related?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
This is a totally separate thing. This is a totally separate thing. It's not related to what we're trying to solve. It needs to be done, but this is a totally separate thing.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yeah. So…

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
This is… this is the territory planning. This is automated territory planning.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
No, no, this is basically just grouping of these related routes together.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Which…

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So, uh, this route said, uh, group routes, by the principle that they are meant to be executed by the same person.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:02.000
This is a very complicated topic that cannot be discussed right now. It's just… this is not… This is just… I don't want to say anything except that it's too complicated to discuss right now.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I will say that the strategic scenario planner. That we have, Igor, it needs to be able to do.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
The same thing that you guys generate with the clusterization algorithm.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:24.000
During the, uh, smart zones that you generate. We need to be able to put…

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Imagine you have Geotab, or Samsara, or some ERP system, or some SAP, whatever.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:40.000
And from all these systems, you get your orders. And your customer locations.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And what we need to do is we need to take any number.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Of orders. 100,000, a million, doesn't matter. It goes into that system… the clusterization engine.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
And it generates the smart zones, and the smart zones get stored to territories.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
With a different status code. Which is basically a territory simulation.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It's basically a copy of the Strategic Optimization Wizard, but rather than doing the route planning mode, you're doing territory planning mode.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000
This is closer to what withdrew, is that territory planning mode.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Where we're proposing ideas for territories. And then in the scenarios, you're putting no more than $100,000 per territory, no more than…

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:44.000
50,000 stops for territory, and no more than… 25 miles between stops, that goes into smart zones. Smart zones generates the ideas, and then it shows almost the same.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:53.000
As this, but based on your historical order data. Or your customers. This is a… this is an interesting topic, but it's not… it's a totally unrelated topic.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Uh, let me put it in another perspective.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So, here is a routes list, and now it has a grouping.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:07.000
by route set, so you can see which routes belong to the same person.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Uh, and so these route sets, they share…

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
There's no concept of routes that belong to the same person. You invented this concept.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah, but… but… but as far as I understand, customers want to visit, so…

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000
the same person visits the same set of customers every time. So, these routes are belong to each, uh, are related to each other, because they share

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
the same set of locations.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And this route, meant to be executed by the same person for this reason, because

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:49.000
They share the same set of destinations.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Uh, and we are missing a grouping on this principle.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
By this criteria.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:10.000
We talked about that, and that… and it's not what you visualize. What you showed, and what you're showing now, is two totally different things.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It's a very different concepts.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000
So, is this, uh, just a grouping, uh, for routes that are related to each other?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Because they share the same set of locations.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Exactly, and I'm saying that it's a totally separate thing. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying that it's actually… it's correct, but it's just totally separate.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Mm-hmm.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Okay, uh… let… Manage Show.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
We know, we know, we know that we need… that, uh…

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
What do you call it?

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:07.000
That mode. We know we need that mode. Hold on a second, I gotta… give me one second, sorry.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Uh… meanwhile, let Manar… share his screen.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Hello, everybody, again. Let me demonstrate…

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Come on.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:50.000
So, as you can see, I had a new tab called Apply Settings. It's closed by the feature flag, so… we can close it anywhere, anytime we want.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It has a few settings that we have right now. It's general, schedule, and optimization.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Like, tabs, sourcing. Everything is from the scenario, and…

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I guess… There will be more.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Because, as always, as I saw in design, it should be more the data.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000
We'll add that later. Right now, we have only 3 tabs, but… It's a quite… self-describable.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Uh, why earliest roads start and latest road start at the same time?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Well, I don't know. So it came in its way.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I'm using the backend, so… It's weird, yeah.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Uh, are you… It's worth. We will check it. It doesn't make…

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Actually, actually, actually, it's possible, but it's worth, because in the solar or in the API, it is just a start time, it's 6 AM.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Yeah. Maybe it's this stage. Like that, hits on the local machine, but I'm using the staging APIs.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Maybe we have another three scenarios. No, no…

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
So that we can…

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Time zone also is not formatted, uh. Uh, user-friendly yet.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah, it will be from after. Yeah, uh, the time zone, uh…

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I have to drop for another call.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Pull request is already merged. I didn't.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Okay? Have a good day.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Thanks, guys.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Uh, we have a time zone. Utilities, but they are in different pull requests, and they just merged yet, so I will add it a little earlier today.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It's fine, it's fine. Look, the main thing… Yeah, Volvoa…

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Here's the confusing part that I'm trying… that when you have a route, and you have the route, and it's the same guy.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And he's doing different. He has 5 days a week that he works, or 4 days a week that he works, and he does the same.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And the forest… on the first week, he does forest stuff. On the second week, he does stuff.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And that what happens is. They, um…

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000
The system needs to provide an opinion. About, okay, these are the same routes?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
That… from week to week? And then that's it.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:42.000
They may not be the same, they may be not the same completely. They may be similar, pretty similar, but they're meant to be visited by the same person. They meant to be assigned to the same person.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
How's the system gonna know that?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Because, uh, those roads share the same set of locations.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
And customers want to…

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000
No, you just said that they're not the same, you just said they're…

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Let's try this one, maybe.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:25.000
No, no, take your… this is also on here. Hey, so I knew…

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:38.000
store.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
told your driver position, I told you the location of SIGDA.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:47.000
The design system is a repeat design is a custom location of the court of a detailer.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Rasputili.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Um, no…

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah, yeah, no. Yeah, that…

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
To share it with the…

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The location… I think that in terms of Chileavan.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Anokur.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And that, then you give away each can create mo. At the mushta…

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I'll just…

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Not the answer. The anti-customers, AT Arstonovsky.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Hey, no, the… In other bulletes, because I… Lotitska also raising.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Ethan, you can create another digital abstract my group across the principal guys.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Okay, Shakarna, yappa… The STBS card show now.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Okay? Now, booted.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Yeah. Yeah, when you might be sneaking.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Oh, the optimization engine, more…

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah, it's not… yeah, yeah, yeah, good… Yeah, good thing to continue with, Tim.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
As you can see, that was snapshot percussion facility.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Hey, you're on with us now.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
manner.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Uh, David on the call, uh, Alexei, David on the call, it's better to switch to English.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Ah, ah, sweet.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000
monarch, maybe we will show, uh… time zone component.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
It's really… yeah.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Let's do it. Let's do it. Yep.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Maybe. Yeah, it's a little… let's see. Deploy, you know? One sec…

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Mm-hmm.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
It's pretty simple. Not following design, but…

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Eventually. Something right here.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:19.000
It's used autocomplete, so you can search. Cool. Any… time zone you want.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It saves the latest… time zones you used, so… They stored in the local storage.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
And we will delete some countries, yeah?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
So, on the browser.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
From this… from the… from this list.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Already deleted some countries. There is not something like Russia or…

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Mm-hmm.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
No, North Korea or something like that. Removed them already.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:55.000
In this time zone is related to upload data, not G2 scenario, because we are setting it on scenario level, so you can pick different time zones for different scenarios. This is kind of…

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
wrong. I believe it should be set on…

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
While you're mapping data.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So, you are…

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
explaining in which time zone

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
data is.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Hey, Dan, this is Dave. I was able to join

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Because you uploaded a file,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Hmm…

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And, uh, it is not obvious in which time zone time that file was.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yeah.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Yes, I think what you're saying, Vova, is that

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Rather than having a generic time zone, the time zone for the locations and the time zone for the facilities are what matter.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Well, I can add that. Now, we are using only lists.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Uh, uh, uh…

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
All available time zones, well, according to our country, or…

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000
I'm not seeing any benefit in allowing to pick different time zones for different scenarios.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Can you… give a pause a little bit? Manar… shows only new component for choosing time zones.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
His work doesn't related to what you're talking about right now.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Yeah.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Hmm.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
We talked about time zones with Dan, uh, a few hours ago.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:29.000
People are working hard on this task. This is the reason why they are not on that call right now. Let's not waste anybody's time, okay?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
If you think this is a waste of time, okay?

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Okay?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
So, David, the…

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I was talking about it.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Me and Igor, we spent 10 hours on time zones. That's why we don't need to talk about it more.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Because they already know what we're doing.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Makes sense, yep. Makes sense.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Yeah, yeah, which is, yeah, which is nice. It's good.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:07.000
There's a time zone picker now, is the point, is the… the main… the main, uh…

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Uh-huh.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
It will be better. We have a new design.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
The big picture, the big picture, David, is that the customer will pick.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:24.000
How they want to do the time zone, so… They want to do it off of the depot, they could do it off of the facility, they could do it off of their account's primary zone, they could do it…

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Based on a variety of different things.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Thank you.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Okay, I'm done. Here.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
That's it. There's no… there's no good answer. The biggest… Volvo, you want to help with the time zones?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Please come up with a design for the timeline. Where… where they could pick the time zone. There's gonna be…

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
The time… the time zone has been changed in the timeline.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:01.000
With a drop-down. They have to pick… They have to pick how they want to see the Gantt chart. The time zone of the Gantt chart. They could pick.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:13.000
The browser's computer time, they could pick… each… they could pick UT, uh, in any arbitrary time zone, or they could pick.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Um… show everything in its own time zone, and then every route.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And the timeline will have its own offset. So, it has to be done.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Very clean. And uh… The easiest… the first thing to do is… to let them pick. They have to pick, uh…

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Yeah. Uh, okay, I'll provide some ideas.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.000
What they want to see on the Gantt chart. And…

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Okay, can you… Igor Manar, can you quickly show David the… really quickly, the weather stuff, and also the, uh…

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:06.000
He was tied up in an important customer call. The weather stuff and the, uh, the preview of the route map, so he could give us some ideas of what we might be missing.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Uh, it's better to ask Evgeny to show, because he's the main developer for Map, for layers.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Yeah, maybe… yeah, that's fine. I thought it was the other guys, it's no problem. Whoever wants to show it can show it.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Do you see my screen now?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So look, David, so I'll walk you through it quickly, just since… I'll talk faster than English.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Yes.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:38.000
This is a preview of the route, so every route that's gonna be on that day is gonna be here. We're gonna add another table to the left, it's gonna have the list of the routes.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
And the calendar picker on top of that. They wanted to jump to another date.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But basically, it's gonna… that's how it's gonna show up over here.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Makes sense, okay.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Yeah, looks good. Yeah.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Okay? So that's… we're getting closer. We're getting closer to what we talked about. So this'll be up in the next few couple days, probably.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Nice, okay.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Yeah, I just… yeah, just, yeah, I just grab one really quickly, yeah.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
looks good.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:17.000
What… if you want to take a screenshot of this, please do, David, because we want… The reason I'm asking is because we might be missing some metrics that we're not… we don't know about, or that… because they're rushing to do it, and so if you have some ideas on certain KPIs.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Okay, I'm gonna fast-forward and say 3 or 6 months from now.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
The customer's gonna be able to select the KPI they want to see.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
But if we're talking about 3 to 6 days from now, we gotta just pick the top 10 KPIs that we think.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Yeah. Makes sense.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Applicable to everybody.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So, the second thing is that we have a new weather layer.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It's gonna… it's gonna be enabled everywhere? Including here.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
And then based… you notice that there's a route start date, so then based on the route start date.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Yeah.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The weather conditions will change on the map. We use it from our weather vendor.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I don't know. Yeah, yeah.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:13.000
See, you see it says what… So, I remember you had a custody… you mentioned that some customers, this is really important for them.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah, that's really nice.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
And then we had…

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And this is… and this is forecasting it for the day, or for the time that they're gonna be there?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Yeah, the day and the time and the place.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, so it's specific to that location for the time that they're at the location, okay.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
So, the next step is then to incorporate this into the routing profile so that.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Their typical weather service slowdowns, all that shit are… are properly, uh, linked.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
So that…

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Is the weather provider provide… I know some weather providers out there will provide specific, uh, you know, road risk scores, different combinations of different weather mean different…

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
degradations in road speed. Are we getting that from them, or we're trying to calculate ourselves?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000
We're trying to calculate ourselves, but I know that this one does have that, we could look into it. In fact, I could send you the info if you want to take… spend 30 minutes.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Sure, yeah.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Smell-tested or contact support, then by all means, you could…

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Yeah, yeah, feel free to send whatever you have. Yeah, I evaluated a bunch of them when I was at Omnitracks, just seeing what they offered, and even, like, TomTom here offered it, because they were

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
getting it from some of the same vendors.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Yeah, there's a legit vendor, I think that they had an M&A deal in the last 2 or 3 years, and they're, uh… focused exclusively on weather and weather optimization stuff, and…

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:47.000
They're real good. So, uh, and they do historical and future. So, and they… and, like, 6 different or 10 different types of…

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh, perfect.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Weather attributes.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:02.000
The idea is obviously that it would change, uh… the customer would say, look, if it's… for every 10 degrees it gets colder, I want to slow down my service time by one… by…

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You know, 10% or 30 seconds, or forget.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Correct, yeah, or fog… fog slows the roads down this much, fog plus rain.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Now, rules engine we gotta put in at the account level.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah. Yeah.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Correct, yeah.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Or the optimization model.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:27.000
This is really great.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Okay, and then, um… Guys, can you show me the filter quick?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
The filters, filters here.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So we've got… there's no… She can find the…

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Okay.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Dimensional and financial filters are wrong.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:58.000
No, they're fixed. Thing. Yeah, that's good.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
She could filter now pretty much anything in the scenario.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:09.000
That's great. Yeah, so you could just look at one specific route for one specific week,

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
or specific days across weeks. Okay, that's great.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah. And then, um…

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And then the other big one is in the route snapshot, we have now information about.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:38.000
The, uh, we just got more info and more variables and other stuff that they brought… that they put into this.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.000
System.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Yeah, can somebody pick the sharing screen for the snapshot? Because, uh, yeah.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I don't think I can do it.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Uh, Igor, can you show… quickly, uh, snapshot from.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Strategic optimization.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:14.000
The thing is Star Wars.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Yeah.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Uh, it's not complete, because we don't have backend endpoint yet, so it uses, uh, mocked data as well.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Uh, but soon, backend will be ready, we will connect. The endpoint.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And it will work. Then it's quite hard to understand your voice completely.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Yeah, it's… yeah, it's choppy, yeah.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Completely break down.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000
We see the settings yet on his mobile screen? Or not yet.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
The route settings. The route settings that were used for the scenario simulation.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Uh, can you repeat which settings?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Remember, he had a loading error, the skeleton was frozen?

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Ah, uh… It's not on staging yet. Manar, can you…

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Yeah, I'm saying, on his local, local, can he show it on the local, please?

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh, Manar Shoal, please, apply its settings again.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:43.000
One second.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Here, we have only 3 scenarios, so… not much information here.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Yep.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:57.000
It's the second one, max row duration 8 hour. Someone created that.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:07.000
We have a tree view here, have a lot of information. It's coming from the backend, so… It's not to mock data, it's real data.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Right now, it's on the staging, so… maybe… not quite.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Great, but I think in production it will be much, much.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Yeah, interesting.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:24.000
This is great, yeah, and this is just a way for them to see what they used.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Yeah.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Yeah. When you created the… Scenarios.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Yes.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Will some… if I go ahead.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And… yeah, David, no, no, you go ahead. You say it, and then… Go ahead, please.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Yeah, my question was gonna be, I know we have a list of scenarios before we get into the route levels, we just have a list of scenarios. Will some of the settings

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
be columns that are available to view for the scenario, so that if I'm looking at a list of scenarios,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000
That's exactly it. That's why I stopped talking, because you fucking… you beat me to it, exactly right.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Yeah.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000
The comparison, the side-by-side comparison.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yes, we will add, of course.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Here's scenarios. We'll add much more information here. Right now, it's, uh…

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Simple one, but I think… It's better to have something, right?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:15.000
You remember, David, our objective is to just… is to just completely obliterate the competition.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
So, it's whatever we learned, but also whatever you could tell us.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Okay.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Okay, anything else?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Not… no, no, not… they… they… they don't. I mean, typically,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
You can get to these settings, but you have to go inside of the…

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
You have to go inside of the actual profiles,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
what they might call a strategic pass, or, you know, a routing pass to be able to see the settings.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
seeing it easy like this, they won't have.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:59.000
And even at the level that we were talking about, and the list of scenarios or optimizations, they wouldn't have it there. It's typically just a list of

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Okay, these are the planning sessions, the scenarios that I ran.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
they wouldn't have some of these applied settings there.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Easily, but for me…

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Yeah.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Yeah, because it's a pain in the ass to compare it. It's like looking at 5 different stocks.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Exactly. But for me, I was even talking with, you know, I was talking with Parker and Vlad about this the other day.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:23.000
If I can see that I ran one scenario at max duration 8 hours, another scenario at max duration 10 hours,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Another one, max duration, you know, 8 hours.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And maybe different number of routes. I did this one at 10 routes, I did this one at 11 routes.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
then very quickly, it becomes really easy to see what all the differences were, you know?

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
here's why I had less unrided locations, here's why, you know…

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
this happened, um…

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
That's exactly right. And we just talked about that at length with the guys. You're totally right.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Yeah.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Which brings me to my next question about… about this, and that question is, um…

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Yeah.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Volvo, can you draw a full-screen mode? Because if I want to compare 25 scenarios as columns… It's not gonna fit in this cute little wide thing. I gotta have it. I need a full-screen mode, similar to the spreadsheet we have in Scope.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Where… I need to be able to see.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
20, 30 columns side by side. Easily. I…

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Now, it is basically the same as the same table you are using when you are defining scenarios, so it will be option, option, option, option, option, and scenario, scenario, scenario, and it will be matrix of options and all scenarios.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Inside here, right? Or something.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Um, no, no, not here. It will be on upper level, on strategic optimization level.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:57.000
So you will be able to compare settings side by side here.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I'll draw it.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
So this is going to be a read-only table with all settings and

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I think… talk to Valyrib Soltis, get to look at… the scope… the scope thing that we have over there.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Inside of Clarify for the spreadsheet view, because that's where we want to see it, as, like, the spreadsheet view, and uh…

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Okay, I'll… I'll ask.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Spreadsheet view in…

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
clarified.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Glorify, clarify a spreadsheet view.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Okay, any questions? Or I can close it.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
No questions?

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
No, did you notice the service time slowdown was in there?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I saw, yeah, I was… yeah, I was, uh…

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So that's the thing that would technically have to change dynamically.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Based on… Um… the weather and the other rules.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Correct, yeah. Yeah.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Would we show this stuff to Iron Mountain? Since…

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I would show them that, yeah. And, I mean, what I would also do, I think, if…

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000
If we can for Iron Mountain. It depends on how the conversation goes.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
But if we want to buy ourselves more time for some of this to be…

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:32.000
all together and ready. We can even try to eat up more time next week just on routing, dispatching, all the asset.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.000
you know, facility stuff that's been built in, the organizational hire, you know.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Everything that they asked for, we can spend time, and then if we want, we can basically say, hey, looks like we might have run out of time to really get

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
deep into strategic planning, we can spend a couple minutes, or we can have another

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
call to really dive into it, and that might buy us more time.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Or we can just try to cover it all, but…

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I think we might be able to…

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Yeah.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Yeah, on the crop quality, yeah.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Well, let's see what… we'll see how it happens, but I guess let's debate it on our, uh… call, but if it gets done by then, what is it Wednesday?

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Uh, next Thursday, the 9th.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I mean, I feel like they might have this, uh, Simone, I think that you guys will have the routes map.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And the routes table on… by the Thursday. It's a long time. It's a week from now.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Uh… Yes, it should be ready.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Before that.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Yeah. Um…

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:38.000
What was the other… two or three other big picture items, David, for… for Iron Mountain? Because they might overlap with what we did. Can you remind me?

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Uh, sure, one second, let me…

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Let me just bring it up real quick, so I'm not, uh, misspeaking here.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:55.000
One second. Uh…

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Where did it go?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Okay, I just opened it up here. Um…

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000
You want me to just share it on my screen, Dan, or…?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Or I can just talk to it, but it was, uh, they did… it was, for them,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
It was customer locations that I think we can easily handle.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Uh…

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:36.000
product optimization, the demo profiles, which I think will be easy to talk through and show them that exist. The database function, like, you know, in their mind, you know, the ability for the system to be the system of record,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
You'll be able to show…

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Uh, drag and drop.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
is already available, correct, from what I recall?

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Where you can drag a stop on the map to another route, or move things around. I think that was… I think you showed me that a couple weeks ago.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Um, reassigned from one stop to another… from one… sorry, from one route to another.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:09.000
the dispatching, I think, is fine.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
map data…

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
height, weight-restricted roads, commercial road restrictions. The only thing that we don't do necessarily is…

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
We don't support historic traffic from a vendor like here or others, but…

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
We have weather, which will be nice.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I mean, we have is traffic in the sense that Google incorporates, and here.com incorporates the historic traffic in their predictions, so when we query.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Their engine incorporates storm data when planning routes and when looking around, so we say.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Give me a route for Monday, the September is gonna know, well, Monday in September, that's… that's, uh… schools… schools in session.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Uh-oh, so we are getting that from Google, or whoever?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:02.000
This road is always busy, then you do is… Well, we… well, every time we plan a route, we query them, and we…

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:12.000
And when we do query, then we get… Um… we could enable, hey, show me how long this route would take with traffic.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:19.000
And then, on this exact date, and then they say, here's what it would be. And then we say, thank you, and we store that shit, and then we show it to the customer.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Oh, okay, okay, got it, got it, okay.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Okay, so it's a yes, then, so it is a yes, okay.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:33.000
They just have to enable it in that when they go… the time calculation method is time with traffic instead of just time.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The one thing, and you know, we do telematics integrations, we can do the strategic planning solution,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I think, you know, like, we've come really far so far, and even if it's not fully there, I think it'll hopefully be enough to, uh…

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
to show them just how much has been built in a short amount of time, and…

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:59.000
how much further it's gonna go, and it already has things that some of the competition doesn't have, like you were pointing out.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Um, the bigger gap, I think, is going to be map edits, which…

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
is… this is just…

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Yeah.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It's him, but what? It's in progress, so Igor, are you here with us?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Yeah.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Still with us? Igor says… Igor and I talked about this already. We're, um…

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:26.000
See, our main JavaScript guy's not on the call with us this second, but… Here's what we're thinking. Um…

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Sure.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:35.000
David, so they… you… we can… we can click… up to… what was it, Igor? 200, 300? Or something?

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Segments?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah, yeah, we have a limit for 250, I must remember.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:50.000
We could pass in 250. Um… 250 segments.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Into the… into our route, into the… Our routing engine, and what a segment is, basically a link on a road.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So, if you tell us, like, look, I need… XYZ, and I needed, uh…

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Then the system will do that. It'll… you can pass in 250 individual.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Road segments into that, and we will honor that as an avoidance zone.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So that… so yes, so you're talking about an avoidance zone. What I'm talking about is… oh, okay.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:24.000
So, we're gonna… No, no, no, but…

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
An avoidance road, an avoidance segment. So let's just do what?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
What's the biggest bridge in Maryland, next to where you live?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Uh, the… the key bridge, probably.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Okay, the Key Bridge. So… If we were to put… if we were gonna put… the Key Bridge has, let's say, 2 roads going in, 2 roads going out.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So we were gonna put… something there, what we would do is, uh…

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Um… We would basically click on the road right before the bridge.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And what we would then do is we would… basically put a red… strike it out, like, call it a red line, or whatever you want to call it. The shit would glow red.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Correct. Yep.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000
They would persistently store. And then, that's it. No routes would be permitted.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000
To ever go through that road. Because of that road segment, we effectively.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Correct, and… and…

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Deleted it off the map.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Yeah, so that's more restricting travel on a road.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
when I was talking about a similar, but maybe a little bit different, um…

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
I have some examples of it here, but here's one.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.000
This is the same presentation I showed you yesterday, just briefly, but you're talking about this. You're talking about restricting travel.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:57.000
So how can I make sure that certain vehicles don't pass on specific roads so I can block this road like you're talking about?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
And now it doesn't go that way, now it goes on this road.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
That's what you're talking about. What the other thing that…

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:09.000
that Omnitrex could do that we… Brian and I were saying Iron Mountain might want.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
There's the ability to get into the map itself,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And this is what RoadNet would take the map from whoever, anyone of a, you know, two dozen vendors, and convert it to their own proprietary format.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:33.000
And then once it was in their proprietary format, they could change address ranges, they could change road names, they could change the road class, and with the road class, a speed change, they could change a speed manually.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000
They could even go in here and change the geometry.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
So they can go into this specific segment,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:46.000
you know, click change shape, and then they could modify the geometry, or they could just add a completely new road. A road doesn't exist…

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
A road isn't here in the digital maps, but it exists in real life.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:57.000
So then I go in here, and when I'm in changing shape, I start adding the rotor, and I start adding the geog… the geometry of the road.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
And I can add all the address range information, the road name, the type of road, all that stuff.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
You could even change whether a street was…

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000
When you were talking about was disabling a road. I could change a road the one way or leave it two-way, or loadable.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Loadable means that a…

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
vehicle can come off the side of it, like here, and go onto the road. If it's not loadable,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
then a vehicle can travel on the road,

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
But it can't hop off of that road to service an account on that road.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
a highway would be a good example of that.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So, um…

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Igor, Igor, we…

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:41.000
So this is more of, like, the editing that Brian and I were talking about, and then they could get into the actual nodes. So all the nodes that connect to the segments could be modified even

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.000
So, for every node, there's a possibility of, you know, multiple different turns, obviously.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Depending on which direction you're traveling. And then here, you could restrict it,

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Or you could assign a penalty for

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:00.000
like, left turns could all be assigned a penalty globally, or just in a specific segment.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
So, not every… here's the thing, not every fleet needs this, but…

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000
But for the large enterprises, like, you know, uh, Iron Mountain, you know, the U.S. Foods, Cisco's, and all of them, a lot of them,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
A lot of them will go down this route.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:25.000
And companies that do a lot of residential deliveries, like Nestle Waters in the past, which is now, uh, Ready Refresh, you know, Blue Triton Primo, all those companies that do a lot of residential deliveries,

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
It doesn't matter who it is, Apple Maps, Google Maps here, TomTom, none of them can keep up with adding roads for new…

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
uh, housing developments fast enough.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000
So what those fleets will do is they'll go in here, and they'll add the roads themselves, because they need to deliver to them.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:47.000
They need to deliver to them for 3, 6, 9 months a year before Google, Apple, or anyone adds them.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:54.000
So then they add them themselves so that they can plan for them and navigate to them.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Okay, but I… Igor… Igor, the… let's just pretend we wanted to do this inefficiently. Isn't this basically us going in.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And letting anyone edit… what's inside of Pre-5, and then they could have their own…

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Pre-5 customized the instance, and uh… we could just query it for that account. Isn't it the same shit?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Yeah, but it's not easy to make, because it's hard to change the existing mapping.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
There's some free… I've seen the free open source. I've seen free open source OSRM.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Modifiers, uh, for OpenStreetMaps that you can go in and…

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Then we can do it, yes, and there are a lot of tools for this, but, uh.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
If they need a real-time update, we are not ready to make it.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Yes, but we can… we can see, and we can check how… how long it will take. But you're right that we can make a different instance for specifically for customer, and run specifically a small map.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
For… for region, for state, or something. Yeah.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Yeah, we just charge… We would just charge, uh…

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Extra. Yeah.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Yeah, that's… I mean, it's essentially what RoadNet did. They just had different map databases. You know, one main… one main map version that served as the master, and then they just created different instances for different customers.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Well, we could… well, we have… I know here.com and Google give you the ability to make some small changes.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000
they… well, they do, they do, and they, um…

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.000
And, I mean, you know, here, and TomTom releases new map updates every week, here every two weeks.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Um, but yes, both of them have tools themselves that allow you to recommend changes and or make changes, similar to OpenStreetMaps.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Um, one of the… one of the things that we had even talked about at Omnitrax, you know,

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:17.000
was… you know, you're doing it differently than Omnitrexid, where Omnitrex was only updating the maps every quarter.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
you're… I believe you're hitting, you know, live maps today via API, so that

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
you're always hitting live, like, you're always hitting the newest version of whatever your provider's providing you.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Which Omnitrex wasn't doing, they were only doing it every quarter.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Um, but one of the things that we had talked about at Omnitrex as well was if somebody was making a change,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Um, if… if I'm Iron Mountain, and you work at Cisco, and I trust you, Dan, because you're just as detail-oriented as I am,

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Maybe I want to benefit from your changes.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:55.000
So one of the things that we had talked about was the ability for customers to see the changes that other customers have made if they want to share them, and if they want to accept them.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And then, you know, if I'm focusing on Maryland and you're focusing on Florida,

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
then you can accept my Maryland changes.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:08.000
And I could accept your Florida changes, and now we both have more up-to-date information for new developments.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
that we're both serving without having to do the work ourselves.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.000
to add roads or modify things, or things like that.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
That's… that's going down a whole different path, but yeah.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Yes, exactly, 100%, exactly.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:23.000
It's like, sounds like enterprise map crowdsourcing.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Exactly.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.000
We could do that too, it's not a problem, as long as… What we need to do is get Volvo to draw.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:42.000
To take some of the open source editors. Make it look like our style, and then present it to… on the road as a sales tool on the roadmap, and if people want to get it.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Then we'll just deploy it, because it's not… it's… And that's it.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Yeah, we could… I mean, we could verify, you know, we could validate interest and things like that, too, when we're engaging with some of these fleets, you know, to make sure it makes sense. I… I…

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I mean, just from past experience, I recall there being interest, but before we get on the path of doing it,

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
We can validate, you know, the interest for a crowdsourced piece, but the map edit piece, at a minimum, I know is

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
needed by the largest fleets.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000
the crowdsourcing piece, interest from some, not all, but, you know…

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000
But it's, you know, it's a… would be a differentiator, too.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Yeah.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
We can easily edit that thing, for sure. There's a ton of open source tools that do it.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Yeah. Yep.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Okay, what… anything else? Any other big stuff we need? Prior Mountain that we might have already done?

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Um…

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
This week… in this week's release. Besides the menu change and those adding the word database.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yeah, besides that, um, yeah, besides that, I would say, uh, I don't…

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Think so?

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Uh, I'm just trying to go through this list again.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:51.000
So, facility-facility types, locations, we have the database piece, we have the asset locations.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
optimization.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
We don't have asset locations yet. We… but Igor, I don't think we're gonna get Simone assets.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Copy and paste it on production by Thursday, are we? Maybe on staging, we could get something on staging, maybe?

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
But I don't know about…

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:15.000
We're gonna get on staging, but it could be our mocking data, or, uh, super simple, uh.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Gotcha. Yeah.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I don't know, API or pages.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.000
As long as we could show a list. What do they actually do? Some sort of asset management, though?

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Uh, today they don't, but…

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.000
So today they don't, but the use cases…

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
But use case-wise, uh, they… they do have multiple…

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Within… within large locations like hospitals, universities, or buildings, they'll have multiple collection boxes that require servicing when they're doing shredding, uh, pickup.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
like, box pickup.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
We support that through… we support that through nested hierarchical customer locations.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Yes.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Which that you could say. This is my location of the hospital, and then in it, I have a sub-location, and you can have as many sub-locations as you want.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Correct, so that's what I would maybe show then, I guess, is the nested, uh, nested location, so, uh…

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Yeah.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Yeah, we have that. Okay.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So, which I would show that. I would definitely show that, because that'll be of interest to them.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Yeah, Brian and I were putting this list together yesterday, and I'm…

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I'm trying to think of anything else that's…

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000
that's notable for you to maybe just kind of know or use here, uh…

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
So, 3 main businesses.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I don't…

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000
So, Melan, is there anything else on your side? That we… that we released this week, Samuel?

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:47.000
That you think is interesting enough that… that we would want to show this or the other clients?

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.000
With the… I… because we only talked about strategic, we didn't talk about anything else right now.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Uh… we… I think it's worth to look at facility snapshot right now.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Hmm.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Okay, let's do it.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Alexei, can you show us a facility snapshot?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Yep.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000
So, should I continue in English, or Spanish direction? Okay, so, uh…

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Only two moments. The first one with the team tap. That duplicates the gym management page.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Fully with that review. And here you can open, and here you can view send routes for this, uh…

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:52.000
So, um… That's all… and with Configurator. That's all for this tab. If there is no question, we can go to another tab. Custom locations, about your…

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
This shows you all the team members that are linked to this facility.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
This facility, yep, yep, yep, you can… you can check this, uh, here.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Yes.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And what is missing here is, uh, calculations on

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Facility to apply. Yep.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:12.000
all these drivers, and they are executing routes within this facility. We need to show counts of…

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000
customers, locations, and routes, this driver executed.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000
within this facility for this time range.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:31.000
This is not a metric screen, this is a hierarchical relationship screen. The metrics and KPIs go elsewhere.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
But it is really one hymn, I believe.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
In context of facilities.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
to see, uh, these are employees of this facility, basically.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:47.000
The problem is, is that we can't… We're not gonna create 5 new APIs and core…

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Architecture changes. Just to add that thing.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
No.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Because this… this is a standard API that they plugged and played.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:03.000
What you're asking for is weeks or months of development work. What we need to do is embed it from Business Insights.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
From the other places, and where we have the counts and metrics by object type.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I see.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:30.000
So, let's move next, and the second tab is customer locations. You asked about to add the grouping or filter by customer name, so we… add filter and grouping too. So here you can see the custom locations, and grouping by customer name for easier searching.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:37.000
So for Iron Mountain, David, this is… so you have 50 facilities, these are all the customers you're servicing out of this facility?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Yeah, no, this is great. Yep.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000
And you can filter by customer name if you want.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:59.000
The only thing is, is that… You see the grouping? It's grouping by customer, so if a customer has multiple sub-locations or multiple locations, they would group that way.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
And could, uh…

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I didn't see it when he was clicking through, um…

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Is it…

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Would it have to be an exact customer name, or would it be, like, uh… almost like a Boolean search, where if I just start typing up a specific customer name, it just…

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Ah, okay. All right.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I think it will be work. Yep.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So anything with… yeah, okay, perfect.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Yeah, yep.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Great. That's great.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That's all from my side. Any questions?

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
No, that looked really good.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Uh… Uh, is it ready for production from your point of view?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Yeah.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:16:00.000
From mine? It's ready to deploy on stage, because for now, it's local development. So, I'm just moving the big users page into the framework, so it should… so it will be the same pages here and here.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Oh, sorry. Uh…

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And I make a few small suggestions? Uh, it would be convenient for me to… if I'm looking at a customer location.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:21.000
It would be… by the way, Orders is here too, David. Important. Orders can be attributed to the facility servicing it, or the facility that has that inventory that is going into that.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Mmm.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:30.000
So orders is here as well, so this is basically all the outstanding orders in that facility, synced from your OMS or whatever.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.000
How would I know whether it's holding the product or not?

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Via a filter, or…?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Okay.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Well, this is not so much inventory, it's more of, like, an abstract concept in that.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:55.000
If that order… if it was a hypothetical. Inventory type of service.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
the correct information, yeah.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Then we'd have to trust that your source system sent to us to… that… of the correct information. Eventually, as… if we do sync with the WMS.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.000
And we could probably run some extra… intelligence on it, you know?

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Yeah, yeah. Yep.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:17.000
And then the one other thing is. The order has a type, so if the… every… do we have a column here, guys, for the order type?

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Because one could be a service, one could be a delivery, so the… If the type is a service, then it doesn't matter. If the type is a delivery, then maybe it does matter, and then that's when we start.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Yeah.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Selling the whole… inventory thing, and, like, you posting on your LinkedIn about…

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Yeah.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Too much inventory, too little inventory, whatever, well… that stuff, now you could potentially…

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Somehow cross-sell that, but… One thing I was gonna say to you guys.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Both on the orders screen and the customer location screen, and the route screen, and the team screen, it would be nice to have a many, many menu where I could click on it.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
And I could either… and I could reassign. To another facility from inside the list.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.000
So that, if I wanted to change the facility fulfilling that order.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Or if I wanted to reassign the driver to another facility.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I don't want… I don't want to go… leave the screen, like, hey, I found something I don't like, let me click on it.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Hmm.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:30.000
And then let me reassign it to another facility. And it's the same thing if I'm in the… region, if I see a list of the stuff in the region, let me click on it and relink the primary.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Thing. Now, facilities have two… you are one-to-many, so you could have one object can be linked to multiple.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Facilities? So, in our case, um… what we could do is…

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
We could take the, um…

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Probably we can take the assign facility button. And, uh, like, in routes.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Nothing wrongs. I've worked with. Like, assigned driver, I mean. We have a button assigned facilities, so when…

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Uh, we… basic…

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Uh, and then this all came about bulk actions, so we need to check boxes here, and…

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
actions with selection.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Um, by bulk, mm?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:13.000
But it could be even in version 1, not even bulk, where it's like, hey, this item, I don't like it here.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Let me move it. You click on it. And you can reassign the facility. I mean, you might as well just add another… another… the same… the same button you have.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
as simplest…

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Right? You have another button for assigned facility.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Implementation, I believe, is a context menu, so you can right-click on any row and do something.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:39.000
You could do the context menu, but you could also do… assigned… you could check… the same button you have for assigned facility and routes.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000
The same ball you have for a signed facility and locations.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:58.000
You could do the same… the same here. If you wanted to… because then you don't have to invent anything new, you already have it.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:03.000
The one thing that… are we missing customers here? Shouldn't we have customers here as well?

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Yes, we are mission customers, and we are mission summary.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Pastor?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Summary's not ready yet. That's why it's not there.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah, vehicles.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
The same for a vehicle. We need that vehicles, too.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Well, this is good enough to go live with, so go live with this, and then add the other shit.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Okay, tomorrow it will be staged, tomorrow morning, I think, and uh… If everything will be done, so we'll release it next week, Monday.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I think that's just my… prediction on it.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Okay? Monday, Tuesday, whatever. Just do it before Thursday.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Okay, that's all from my side. Thank you.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Alexei, do we have anything else, uh… Alexeya Fanasyv, I mean.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:03.000
This is old. This is all…

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:08.000
If nothing else, I really want to share something while David is here.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:18.000
And in case of some opinions.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
This is a summary.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Over a scenario in a strategic planner.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Oh, wow.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:33.000
So, uh, what it does, it shows basic stats at the top.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Uh, how…

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
totals in this scenario.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Mm-hmm.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.000
And also, it shows a couple of breakdowns by different aspects.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:47.000
So, you can see breakdown rows by distance.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Lone rows, short roads, and so on, total roads.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
You can see the program by duration.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Show throats, all long roads.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:00.000
You can see routes by destinations count.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:09.000
time distribution by activity type, traveling, waiting, breaks.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
vehicle utilization.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
a long time.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000
uh… break down…

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:24.000
by weekdays, so you can see busy weekdays and free weekdays.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Uh, you can see distribution of routes by week.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Uh, weeks, busy weeks and empty weeks.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.000
And… whatever else we need here? I'm…

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Welcome for ideas. Do you think this is useful?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Uh, definitely, yeah.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Yeah, and this is more than most… this is more than most…

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:56.000
People will… even if some people provide some of this information, it's all tabular, not…

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
in a graphic format like this, so this summary dashboard view is really, really great.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Um…

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:10.000
There's a couple other metrics I might add that sometimes people look at, um…

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
We know what our costs are,

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Um… I don't think I saw…

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I don't think I saw cost information.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.000
But knowing what the cost is, I think, would be good.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
And then, um…

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000
like, similar metrics, but around the cost, and then a lot of times,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
when I was doing routing,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:38.000
And doing a baseline comparison against the optimized solution, I was looking at cost as a percent of sales.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:50.000
But not just… not just, uh, you know, let's say my… my destinations are the same, my routes might… may or may not be different, the duration might be different, total distance might be different, cost,

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
You know, would be different, revenue would be the same,

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.000
But I might look at my costs as a percent of sales as a whole,

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:01.000
And, uh, individually at a route level.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:05.000
And then when I'm looking at the comparison of the scenarios,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Scenario by scenario, not in the… not just in the individual view, but when I'm looking at the scenarios, I might look and say, okay, my cost as a percent of sales is…

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.000
15% versus 18%, so I just took 3% off.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
3% of the, you know, cost off.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
through the optimization that I did.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Some basically divide this basis, and you see the…

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Yes, exactly, yeah.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000
How…

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000
And you can do that at the individual route level, but then also at a scenario level.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
I can find some examples of…

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Yeah, but the problem is, is that you don't know… You don't know what to trust to build your cost basis. What do you… how are you supposed to know that?

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Like, is it per stop? Is it per hour? Is it per… I know for the old one we can, but… to get it building correctly, how do you know for the new one?

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Is it per mile?

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Well, for the new one, it would be making sure… it would be making sure that we're accounting for all of it, and I think I might have

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Might have sent some feedback on this in a thread, but…

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.000
One of the things that… that was, uh…

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000
One of the things that we could account for in RoadNet was a couple more cost dimensions.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
that made sure that…

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
You know, almost all of the typical fixed and variable costs

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
cost metrics were captured.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
And then that just ensured that, um…

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:30.000
That ensures that when we were looking at… let me share my screen really quickly here.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.000
And then we gotta get ready for that other call in a couple minutes, but uh…

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Share screen.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Let's see here…

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I'll… let me zoom.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:44.000
We have… we could track costs at the stop level, the driver level, the hour level.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Correct, but some of what we're missing

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Some of what we're missing… I think we're missing a couple fields that I remember seeing, um…

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Yeah.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
We're missing a lot of stuff. Uh, we're missing a lot of stuff.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
We're mixing just the route cost, which is like, hey, this is my cost per route, I don't… no matter what, it's just…

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Yeah, and I think what I saw, like, I think what I saw is we can do, like, an hourly rate, and we can do a distance rate, but the distance rate doesn't differentiate distance rate for a worker versus a vehicle. It's just a distance rate, I believe.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:20.000
en route for me. Whereas… whereas with RoadNet and some other solutions, but let's just use RoadNet as the example,

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000
You could have a regular rate and overtime rate, a per-stop rate, a distance rate,

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000
And even a…

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.000
a per… a per-size over minimum, so anytime you get above a certain minimum,

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:45.000
You know, in a quantity, a delivery quantity, then they get paid, you know, and then you could even determine when the overtime hours begin, 8 hours, 9 hours, whatever it might be.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
And then on the vehicle side, it was similar.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Um, let me see the…

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Sure, this is great.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Yes, yeah, yeah, I agree. We have 70-80% of what we need, and then on the vehicle side, it was fixed cost,

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Because even when the vehicle's sitting, you're still paying for it. I'm still paying a lease, or it's depreciating, so I might be paying… I'm making this up $150 a day, right?

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.000
So even when it's sitting, I'm paying for the vehicle to sit, and then my variable cost is my cost per mile.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Which is cost for fuel,

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Plus cost for repair and maintenance.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.000
So, at this point, you know, we can't figure this out for them. They need to enter their own shit in here.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:34.000
the fields are at least available, and we're separating variable costs for the worker versus variable costs for the

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.000
for the vehicle. And in this instance, there might not be a variable cost for the worker,

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
The worker might not have a variable cost,

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:46.000
If he's a driver, unless he's an over the… unless he's getting paid per mile, the worker might not have that.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
The vehicle itself is incurring a variable cost.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
So it's just kind of separating it out.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And then sometimes…

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Some vehicles might have hourly costs, so this was just kind of accounting for… accounting for some of that.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:11.000
But then it was the combination of all these things coming together in the scenarios, you know, or in routing, because these fields were the same in routing, or for strategic optimizations,

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:14.000
That's what added up to the total cost.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And then that's what allowed people to do that kind of pre-post comparison.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.000
This all sounds great, but we need to add…

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Tell us the roadmap. What was the roadmap? Uh, Simone, what's the roadmap for the release by… for next Thursday?

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:49.000
For the strategic… obviously, the bug fixes, but then the strategic route plan, or what… the map?

02:28:49.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Um… So, uh, we must add the filters about weekdays and days for, uh, destination, uh, for visits.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Map for, uh, locations. A map for, uh, destinations, uh, for routes inside the scenario.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Uh… draft snapshots, I mean, for insights strategic.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Uh… systems. Uh, bug fixes, etc, facility snapshot, uh. Your facility snapshot.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Um… just thinking, did I miss something else? Um…

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Uh, Alexei Fanas, did I miss something else, or… that's it?

02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:00.000
It's our plan, basically, for the week.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I can send you this file too, Dan, but this is an example of an Excel file I built just when I was doing

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Scenario planning using their tool.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Where I basically just pasted some information, and then the rest calculated out.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:21.000
But a lot of times, we would look at, like, you know, miles per stop, cases per stop, dollars per stop, dollars per square mile, stops per square mile.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:29.000
So that I was talking about before, like, you know, a route cost per stop, or route cost as a percent of sales, so route by route, I could see what the call… what routes…

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:36.000
were generally more expensive to run than others, so if some routes were 4%, other routes were 12%, 15%.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000
And then I can compare it against each other,

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
And again, this is all in Excel, because

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:53.000
some of the nice inputs and all that weren't built in, but then I could look very quickly and say, okay, you know, pre-post, you know, 7.3% cost of the percent of sales versus 7.4%.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:00.000
And in this instance, you could see, you know, how things were changing. And sometimes you're adding routes, and sometimes your costs do increase.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:08.000
But it was very easy to kind of see these cost, you know, these cost differences, you know, how things were increasing. And here, I would even break it out.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Knowing what fixed costs were, you know, I would look at, you know, hey, depreciation,

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:18.000
fuel, repair, maintenance. That was me just breaking it out and calculating it separately.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Just to try to get some, you know, some easier comparison side-by-side between the different scenarios.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:30.000
We have to drop here for the trans cold call, but I can send this off to you later.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Right.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Okay. Okay, there's a… there's a few small things for the strategic.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:49.000
That… Uh, we need to… that we need to do, Simone, also, that, uh…

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Let me think about it, and I'll tell you, but I think the main one was the preview, and the route consistency metric.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Gotta look at the route consistency metric. We gotta get to a gate, and…

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And Igor, to help us with that.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Uh, yeah, and if it will be, uh, controlled by the same switcher from front-end, uh.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:21.000
It will… will work automatically, basically. Uh, also…

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:34.000
We must finish, uh… routed, unrouted issue, but… I believe it will be resolved soon.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:39.000
The main thing for recurring is… is, uh…

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:51.000
The mapping… I think once the mapping, it shows up… And I would say the highest party on the mapping is showing the list of the routes. The routes are showing the…

02:32:51.000 --> 02:33:00.000
The polyline is totally pointless. If you don't show the list of the routes at the same time next to the polyline.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
There's no point.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Agree. Uh… And I think it's pretty simple to add a list of routes, because we already have the same.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Because it already has it. Yeah.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Yeah, we have the same list for orders on routes, and in a couple on… And in a couple of other places.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
So, it's basically copy and paste and connect existing. Endpoints.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Exactly. Exactly.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Uh, I will, uh… Well, I think Evgeny will add it quickly. I'll ask him to do it tomorrow and prepare tickets for that, uh, my morning. I hope it will be pretty quick.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Okay, let's discuss one.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I think it'll be fine.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
One small think about, uh, about…

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.000
the problem with naming.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000
So, he was, uh, upload locations.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Yes.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.000
And we need to show here the custom allocation layer.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:07.000
And they have the same name.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Right now.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:32.000
So, Jenny, what do you think?

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
No. Smarty, uh…

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Chelsea shows up across… provide me to assets.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Customer locations, da.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Look, costuming locations, he has it.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Are stored as a location in.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.000
at the import location.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
As this customer.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Okay, I tell them to…

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
No, eta… no… no…

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:22.000
At the… at the…

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:33.000
That's a little bit. Heat map.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Last year's categorio. He cooked the Chernik Golich gives the life of pod menu, pod…

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Of what facilities, pod locations, pod assets, pod… vehicles…

02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Norway Golichki… Nogalicke Bundesliga. Heat map. Eh…

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.000
With the live chatting materials, occasions.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Uh-huh.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:27.000
So, slowing customer allocation of Nistia?

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:35.000
The…

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Etta.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Mm-hmm.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:51.000
rich,

02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:11.000
each captain is that same.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:20.000
So. Yes, yesterday, this tweeting, I think Kakova go over it, yesterday, yes, Leon Prafty, there might be an image.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Dvati, but… eat a lot of it.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Good.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:47.000
The what?

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Layers. But private locations?

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Customer locations.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Checkbox.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Players, uh…

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Okay, what?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
solute.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Wiki, what the… what that?

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000
emotional ideation. Emotional leadership.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.000
basically external. Yeah, ab businessnika…

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.000
No. Ettagles.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Da.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
phone. That's changed up.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
eta.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Uh, glove necessarily carpe.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000
With the sleeve.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Alright, so the Polynesian Sleep, right?

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Bakar is legit.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Hmm. Notebookie.
