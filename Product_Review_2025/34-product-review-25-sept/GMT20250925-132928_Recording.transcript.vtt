01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.500
Dan Khasis: nada.

636
01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.240
Dan Khasis: No, it's another stop presentingo.

637
01:42:29.130 --> 01:42:45.840
Semeyon S: ti.

638
01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:59.450
Semeyon S: na.

639
01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.310
Dan Khasis: At the door store.

640
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:15.209
Dan Khasis: Okay, just cause I…

641
01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:27.650
Dan Khasis: best practices.

642
01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.649
Dan Khasis: Radimogo de la Carava.

643
01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.670
Dan Khasis: Stubernier.

644
01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.760
Dan Khasis: You cook down into that,

645
01:43:57.130 --> 01:44:05.190
Dan Khasis: Relationship.

646
01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:24.990
Semeyon S: pricrasana.

647
01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:26.980
Semeyon S: route groups.

648
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:35.860
Vova: nastavo.

649
01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:36.270
Semeyon S: that.

650
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:36.930
Vova: campaign.

651
01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:44.520
Dan Khasis: jest.

652
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:49.370
Semeyon S: I should read in the UI commotion scratch.

653
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:53.350
Dan Khasis: at least… But that's name the staging initial.

654
01:44:53.350 --> 01:45:03.180
Vova: nihadin.

655
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:22.100
Vova: doztunari.

656
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:39.669
Vova: I po tumo.

657
01:45:48.570 --> 01:45:50.060
Dan Khasis: Raznette.

658
01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.159
Dan Khasis: Not the mere notes.

659
01:46:01.710 --> 01:46:02.900
Semeyon S: Which is a life insurance.

660
01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:11.440
Dan Khasis: Yeah, it denotes… eti notes,

661
01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:33.070
Dan Khasis: So how much larger the chest did the… Oh… automatic scheduling task.

662
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:44.959
Dan Khasis: in a short scheduling task for Osteozzio Pro Sigre, with all the lead.

663
01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:47.170
Dan Khasis: It's a problem scenario.

664
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:50.790
Igor Skrynkovskyy: bonjours a poster.

665
01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:58.330
Igor Skrynkovskyy: On a traboto.

666
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:00.110
Dan Khasis: Hmm.

667
01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:09.280
Dan Khasis: And here's a torching board, Rossi.

668
01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.790
Igor Skrynkovskyy: What?

669
01:47:36.710 --> 01:47:41.360
Igor Skrynkovskyy: i,

670
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:00.640
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Doctor.

671
01:48:13.330 --> 01:48:16.520
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Touch the consistency on mentioning our chats.

672
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:20.030
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yes, yes.

673
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.909
Dan Khasis: Should they measured?

674
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:27.540
Igor Skrynkovskyy: dolci, por…

675
01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:32.970
Dan Khasis: Stock Hoosier. Consistency Hoosier.

676
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:38.850
Igor Skrynkovskyy: No polisha et cetera.

677
01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:58.820
Igor Skrynkovskyy: pet destination.

678
01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.970
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Causeland.

679
01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.860
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Okay, okay.

680
01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:13.120
Dan Khasis: Okay, Dr. Pierte Projo.

681
01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.360
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Oh, smudry.

682
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:36.290
Vova: deleted.

683
01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:40.050
Igor Skrynkovskyy: iftrai.

684
01:49:40.650 --> 01:49:41.300
Vova: Huh.

685
01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:43.160
Dan Khasis: And he buffed it out.

686
01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:57.350
Vova: I didn't realize that we needed it.

687
01:49:57.350 --> 01:50:18.090
Igor Skrynkovskyy: domania.

688
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:23.540
Artur Moskalenko: komikarta.

689
01:50:28.710 --> 01:50:29.110
Igor Skrynkovskyy: mute.

690
01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:32.829
Oleg Pravyk: Sarkarovko, but I want destinations.

691
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:47.150
Oleg Pravyk: from Nicely.

692
01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:50.630
Igor Skrynkovskyy: No, that's.

693
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:56.700
Oleg Pravyk: That are the two dreams of food.

694
01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:57.370
Igor Skrynkovskyy: That's fair.

695
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:58.129
Oleg Pravyk: No, no, no.

696
01:50:58.130 --> 01:50:58.939
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Good to be on.

697
01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:07.860
Vova: Taroi.

698
01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:28.790
Igor Skrynkovskyy: dastaviarne.

699
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:48.529
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Pad destination,

700
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:58.979
Dan Khasis: Parker, Parker, can you hear?

701
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:02.749
Parker Woodward: Yes, I'm here.

702
01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:08.750
Dan Khasis: Okay, this is the new algorithm for, for, what do you call those?

703
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:11.530
Parker Woodward: Strategic Optimizer.

704
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:13.790
Dan Khasis: Lexington Wholesalers.

705
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.009
Parker Woodward: Pizza wholesalers? Yeah.

706
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:17.890
Dan Khasis: Yeah.

707
01:52:22.890 --> 01:52:24.070
Dan Khasis: So…

708
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:28.539
Parker Woodward: You can continue in Russian, I speak fluently.

709
01:52:29.050 --> 01:52:33.669
Dan Khasis: I know, I know, but they're better at English now.

710
01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:34.689
Parker Woodward: Thank you.

711
01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:42.260
Dan Khasis: So… We did, we did the two scenarios now with this, with this, with this new algorithm.

712
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:48.739
Dan Khasis: Igor, how, by the way, is there a flag for the algorithm? Or how does it…

713
01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.229
Dan Khasis: How does he know to run that correctly?

714
01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:00.239
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Sorry, I didn't get what you mean.

715
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:05.890
Dan Khasis: How does the cement… the route consistency flag? Is that a… is that.

716
01:53:05.890 --> 01:53:06.579
Igor Skrynkovskyy: The new wizard.

717
01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:07.210
Dan Khasis: flag?

718
01:53:07.210 --> 01:53:08.930
Igor Skrynkovskyy: No, we, it is…

719
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:09.680
Semeyon S: Yes.

720
01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:16.210
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yes, it is inside the… inside the wizard, but here we don't have this flag, so…

721
01:53:16.210 --> 01:53:19.779
Dan Khasis: That's fine, we're gonna add the flag, but it's in the wizard.

722
01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.359
Dan Khasis: So that's good.

723
01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:29.839
Dan Khasis: Okay, so let's just show Parker the results, or Parker could tell you where to click.

724
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:32.410
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Fair.

725
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:37.759
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Here is our flag for enabling, disabling.

726
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.760
Parker Woodward: Nice.

727
01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.300
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Okay, here's the two, two routes, two, scenarios.

728
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.320
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Dan, remind me, there's one thing.

729
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:57.750
Parker Woodward: I don't kind of muddy the waters with it, but it's an important piece related to the opposite of blackout dates, but, you know…

730
01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.680
Parker Woodward: Go ahead.

731
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:08.940
Dan Khasis: Yeah, well, I don't understand one other thing, which is, how come the look, the destination count is different if it's not a bug?

732
01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:11.969
Dan Khasis: If you uploaded the exact same file, how's that different?

733
01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:26.509
Parker Woodward: it's not so much the… those are just the total des… I believe those are the total destinations that are routed based on whatever the variables you've input. So you have… must have different variables that you input. There's another.

734
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:32.749
Dan Khasis: Yeah, but the number of locat… okay, so if this is the number of actually routed destinations.

735
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:35.200
Parker Woodward: Yeah. This is wrong. This is totally wrong.

736
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.320
Dan Khasis: Also.

737
01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:38.119
Igor Skrynkovskyy: It's total visits.

738
01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:45.929
Dan Khasis: Because this is… the maximum it could be is 279 times 2 is the maximum.

739
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:48.529
Dan Khasis: Would I… in this case.

740
01:54:48.530 --> 01:54:49.130
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Tom.

741
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.909
Dan Khasis: It's… let's just say, for argument's sake, it's total visits.

742
01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:57.959
Dan Khasis: Hypothetically, let's just pretend that we're good with that.

743
01:54:58.970 --> 01:55:03.450
Dan Khasis: then… The problem is,

744
01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.319
Dan Khasis: How many destinations are not routed?

745
01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:14.430
Parker Woodward: There's… there should be… if you… there should be a… no, there should be a filter for that already.

746
01:55:14.730 --> 01:55:15.370
Parker Woodward: Oracle?

747
01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:20.189
Dan Khasis: I have another question. How, Igor? Route consistency is supposed to be worse.

748
01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:23.330
Dan Khasis: Not better.

749
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:27.909
Dan Khasis: And yet, no route consistency had less routes?

750
01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:30.260
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yes.

751
01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:32.599
Dan Khasis: And how's that? That's a bug, isn't it?

752
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.199
Igor Skrynkovskyy: In the back, yes. Because, you're right that this is

753
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:45.850
Igor Skrynkovskyy: It should be, 558, yes. And, this is con… is incorrect.

754
01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:55.380
Parker Woodward: Scroll, but if you scroll, are they routed to some… There's routed and unrouted, but… Right there.

755
01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.269
Dan Khasis: Yeah, that's correct, that's good.

756
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:59.269
Dan Khasis: And I think that that should…

757
01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:05.600
Dan Khasis: All of this garbage about created routes and failed routes, we need to hide that by default.

758
01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.239
Dan Khasis: We don't need that right now.

759
01:56:07.570 --> 01:56:08.759
Dan Khasis: It's too confusing.

760
01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:16.829
Parker Woodward: This… these four are very good.

761
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:17.450
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Hello.

762
01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:18.980
Parker Woodward: These should be front and center.

763
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:21.130
Dan Khasis: Yes.

764
01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.299
Dan Khasis: So, Gabe, can you move those to the columns?

765
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:28.960
Parker Woodward: And make default.

766
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:47.989
Igor Skrynkovskyy: We have it in the columns.

767
01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.220
Dan Khasis: The sequence is wrong.

768
01:57:05.890 --> 01:57:13.460
Dan Khasis: the default sequence is wrong. How about this? Sparker will send a proposed sequence to Shige, And Simeon.

769
01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:16.049
Dan Khasis: And you guys will deploy it, okay?

770
01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:19.880
Semeyon S: Sure.

771
01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:30.140
Dan Khasis: Okay, so then… We're gonna rename destinations to visits, to… Total visits.

772
01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.310
Dan Khasis: Right?

773
01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.430
Semeyon S: Okay.

774
01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.569
Dan Khasis: So why is it… I still don't understand, Igor, how this is possible.

775
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:45.490
Igor Skrynkovskyy: It's a… it's a… it's a definitely bug.

776
01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:46.970
Dan Khasis: But whose book?

777
01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:57.049
Igor Skrynkovskyy: I don't know yet. We need to analyze it, because you're right that, we need to have two times of this number maximum, but

778
01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:07.430
Igor Skrynkovskyy: We have adjusted, some addresses, locations, which are bi-weekly,

779
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:21.039
Igor Skrynkovskyy: So, we will expect even less than 2 times. And as you see, we have a 13% of unrouted routes, so it's definitely not correct.

780
01:58:21.610 --> 01:58:22.220
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Is this stuff?

781
01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:28.899
Dan Khasis: Well… Let's just assume those numbers get fixed, so now let's compare.

782
01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:33.609
Dan Khasis: Let's compare the route's consistency, if you open that up for a second.

783
01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:43.929
Dan Khasis: So, Parker, how would… how would…

784
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:50.790
Dan Khasis: Patrick, go ahead now and analyze this. What would he do? What would he tell you to click? He'd say, let's click on

785
01:58:51.110 --> 01:58:55.690
Dan Khasis: Monday, Of the first week and Monday of the second week, right?

786
01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:05.649
Parker Woodward: I mean, what he'd probably do is import these as ad hoc routes and start to export them, and then just view them week to week, and, you know.

787
01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:08.440
Dan Khasis: Yeah, but we already… but we already have…

788
01:59:09.630 --> 01:59:10.110
Parker Woodward: But what we.

789
01:59:10.110 --> 01:59:17.520
Dan Khasis: we're… we're working on a map, and we're working on a comparison view, so if he were to pick Monday and Monday.

790
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.940
Parker Woodward: Exactly.

791
01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:29.490
Dan Khasis: Week 41, Monday. Where's week… week 42, Monday? Okay, so going back to the gate, it shows the filters. Where's… pick… pick now, we got new filters, here you go, weekdays. Okay.

792
01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.510
Parker Woodward: Nice.

793
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:31.940
Dan Khasis: weekdays, weekdays.

794
01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:40.160
Dan Khasis: Okay, and I hit Monday. The sequence here is fucked, I think, of the weekday short sequence is wrong.

795
01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:41.060
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Eric.

796
01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:50.360
Dan Khasis: But you could show this to Patrick, too, and get Doug and Patrick off of that… that thing, the garbage they're talking about right now. Week 42, week 41.

797
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:57.649
Dan Khasis: So now I'll go ahead and add another filter. Let's do week 41, 40… we don't need to, sorry, there's only two of them. Okay, sorry.

798
01:59:58.010 --> 02:00:02.329
Dan Khasis: So we got… The bi-weeklies have more, it looks like.

799
02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:09.619
Parker Woodward: Yeah, that's where… so… From what I can see, this one and this one are probably…

800
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:20.780
Parker Woodward: the same route, but there's no way necessarily to understand that that's week 42, Day 1, Route A, or Route A, you know, whatever we want to call it.

801
02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:23.420
Parker Woodward: Sorry, shit, I just fucked that up.

802
02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:29.009
Dan Khasis: I know what you're saying. Let me explain it to the team. So, look, Igor, the situation is that…

803
02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:32.760
Dan Khasis: This one and this one are probably the same route.

804
02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:41.199
Dan Khasis: let's just say, for our given sake, but there's no parity between 3. So it's number 3 on this one, hypothetically.

805
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:46.610
Dan Khasis: And it's number 1 on this one. So how would the person know? See, it matches perfectly.

806
02:00:47.290 --> 02:00:54.330
Dan Khasis: But because we don't have route part numbers, or checksums, maybe we need to do a checksum, or something.

807
02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:58.620
Dan Khasis: Because there's no way to know, because the pro… you see.

808
02:00:59.150 --> 02:01:01.549
Dan Khasis: Click destination schedule for a second.

809
02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:09.360
Dan Khasis: You see, at the customer level, You could see that…

810
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:12.859
Dan Khasis: This is, again, the same fuck-up, Sergey, as before.

811
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:19.880
Dan Khasis: We have dimensional attributes with financial attributes stuck like a zenosa in the middle of everything.

812
02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:25.499
Dan Khasis: Right? It doesn't… it should not be here. Weight, cube, piece, these are all dimensional attributes.

813
02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:31.000
Parker Woodward: They do want… they do want weight there, eventually.

814
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.489
Dan Khasis: Wade is there already, what do you mean, eventually? It's already live.

815
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:36.470
Parker Woodward: Oh, I thought you said we didn't want them.

816
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:44.530
Dan Khasis: No, what I'm saying is the default sequencing is screwed up, because the financial metrics were jammed in between dimensional ones.

817
02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:45.610
Parker Woodward: Gotcha, gotcha.

818
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:48.389
Dan Khasis: Okay, so look, so here's what I'm saying.

819
02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:51.709
Dan Khasis: Go to the right more, go to the right.

820
02:01:53.100 --> 02:02:00.090
Dan Khasis: We need the exact same thing at the route level. I don't know if Volvo needs to think how to do it. I don't have a good idea.

821
02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.250
Dan Khasis: When you look at the routes.

822
02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:07.639
Dan Khasis: You need to be able to see that, somehow, that this route is actually the same

823
02:02:08.190 --> 02:02:11.449
Dan Khasis: For week 1, and week 2, and Week 3,

824
02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:23.920
Dan Khasis: there is Route 1… the problem is Route 1 on week 1 is not equal to Route 1 on week 2, even though there is a week… a Route 1 that is a perfect match.

825
02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:25.869
Dan Khasis: But in the, in the list.

826
02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:34.650
Dan Khasis: The solver is changing it, so week 1, week 2, week 3, Route 1.

827
02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.719
Dan Khasis: Is that, let's just say, is here, and then…

828
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:50.240
Dan Khasis: in week 2, the same route is Route 2, and in week 3, the same route is Route 3, but that's wrong. Technically, it's always Route 1, Route 1, Route 1.

829
02:02:51.170 --> 02:03:01.069
Vova: Are we assigning those routes to vehicles, for hypotypical vehicles? Because we can group by vehicle, if we do.

830
02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:07.280
Parker Woodward: These will eventually, but not all, clients will assign my vehicle.

831
02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.500
Parker Woodward: These will eventually be by vehicle because they want to use a weight capacity.

832
02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:15.300
Parker Woodward: would mix fleet.

833
02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.259
Parker Woodward: But… Not all clients will use that.

834
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:26.610
Parker Woodward: I wonder if you just kind of created… colorization.

835
02:03:27.710 --> 02:03:30.450
Parker Woodward: That's probably not the best way to do it, though.

836
02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:52.669
Parker Woodward: I wonder if you could add a flag into these.

837
02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:53.280
Igor Skrynkovskyy: So…

838
02:03:54.850 --> 02:04:00.469
Parker Woodward: Even just to say, for example, instead of a checkbox, Or a checkbox with a…

839
02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.670
Parker Woodward: Identifier to say that this one is on the same…

840
02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:10.179
Parker Woodward: Just keeping the route consistency week to week.

841
02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:17.630
Vova: We can add a group in here, and group routes in this table by… by route.

842
02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:54.340
Vova: i kacemission.

843
02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:24.710
Vova: No leis.

844
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:28.129
Vova: I mean, over the years.

845
02:05:28.130 --> 02:05:39.020
Dan Khasis: Okay.

846
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:41.709
Dan Khasis: Parker,

847
02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:51.329
Dan Khasis: Do you understand so far, in the… all the English stuff that we talked about? We need to look at the bug about why the numbers don't add up, but…

848
02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:55.029
Dan Khasis: I think you got screenshots now for Patrick to show him…

849
02:05:55.690 --> 02:06:03.529
Dan Khasis: the route consistencies going live, and I… and sergey, how much time do we need to finish to deploy filters on production?

850
02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:08.880
Serhii Kasainov: Just need the QA approval.

851
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:12.929
Dan Khasis: If you want extra QA help, Parker can do it.

852
02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:21.900
Serhii Kasainov: Nice. Maybe we will hide a couple of filters, because they need a backend after complete.

853
02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:24.819
Serhii Kasainov: to work properly.

854
02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:32.070
Parker Woodward: So, I just have 3 things. One…

855
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:44.050
Parker Woodward: Are we confident the week-to-week is giving us the consistency we want? The answer to that is yes, correct me if I'm wrong. Two, the other issue is with time zones.

856
02:06:45.170 --> 02:06:54.190
Parker Woodward: Is that… what's the status of that? And third is, I'd like to talk about…

857
02:06:55.080 --> 02:07:10.330
Parker Woodward: the opposite of blackout dates, which is kind of specific dates that have stopped. This is for a different opportunity, Dan. This is with AblePest. They have 700 vehicles nationwide. They actually want to use the API.

858
02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:16.840
Parker Woodward: to leverage Strategic Optimizer, so it's a little bit different, but those are 3 things that…

859
02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:19.119
Parker Woodward: I'd like updates on.

860
02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:27.869
Dan Khasis: I don't understand the… I don't understand the question for.

861
02:07:28.730 --> 02:07:29.630
Parker Woodward: Blackout dates?

862
02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:35.639
Dan Khasis: Yeah, they want specific white dates? Like, specific dates they want to do? I don't get it.

863
02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:44.609
Parker Woodward: Exactly. So, for example, they have a specific date, or even a date range that they have to hit that location. They can only go during that location.

864
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:47.789
Dan Khasis: Dates, or days of the week?

865
02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.450
Parker Woodward: Date.

866
02:07:54.440 --> 02:08:01.659
Parker Woodward: So, upcoming, like, 10-13, you know, October 13th. I can only go during that time.

867
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:04.240
Dan Khasis: Okay.

868
02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:08.790
Dan Khasis: That's a different algorithm. We have to… Igor and I have to think about it.

869
02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:09.990
Parker Woodward: Okay.

870
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:14.269
Dan Khasis: It sounds to me that it's more of, like, an offset algorithm, where…

871
02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:19.360
Dan Khasis: They tell us the date, they gotta tell us the start date, they tell us the exact date.

872
02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:23.970
Dan Khasis: And then… We send the solver

873
02:08:24.170 --> 02:08:30.129
Dan Khasis: the offset date relative to the start date, so if it's October 13th and it's the 25th.

874
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:48.680
Dan Khasis: And there's 31 days in September, we would do start date of September 25th, plus 6, plus 13, and the whitelist would show 19, and it would say, this address is only visible on the 19th day relative to the start. Then it would put it there. That's how I would probably do it. Right, Igor?

875
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:52.070
Parker Woodward: To be… to be clear, Dan, it's… they have…

876
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:57.689
Parker Woodward: They have that, and you probably already know this, but they have that, and…

877
02:08:57.810 --> 02:09:01.840
Parker Woodward: It's in combination with the,

878
02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:25.020
Parker Woodward: days that can be visited. So, for example, the way in which they use it, they call it an affinity. So they have, you know, their starting day is 1 and ending day is 20. What that means to them is that they set their cycle, that's a monthly cycle for them, 1 to 20, because there's 5 business days in a week for them. So they may say this stop is 1 to 20,

879
02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:42.650
Parker Woodward: They may say this stop is 1 to 10, meaning it needs to be visited in the first half of the month, and then they may have, other stops that are 11 to 20, meaning the second half of the month, and then they'll have other stops that are, days

880
02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:57.370
Parker Woodward: 6 to 9, where those are the specific days that they need to run within the schedule. Then they'll also have specific dates that are locked, right? So, most of those are what they call unlocked.

881
02:09:57.370 --> 02:10:03.479
Parker Woodward: So they just have an affinity there, and then they have locked dates, where they say, this is the exact date.

882
02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:06.760
Parker Woodward: That I need… I have to… I have to make it on this date.

883
02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.810
Dan Khasis: I don't think it's a problem, Igor, what do you think?

884
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:23.900
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Sorry, I'm trying to, to multitask and solve the problem. Can you repeat, or…

885
02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:29.030
Dan Khasis: I'll repeat it in Russian quickly. We… When you snip,

886
02:10:41.610 --> 02:10:49.939
Dan Khasis: 80 client of Mordzo Pashad. Poshy Shad.

887
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.329
Dan Khasis: There would create measures at 80 grand or more to push a shot.

888
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.900
Dan Khasis: Yeah, the memorial range, memorial range priority to.

889
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.250
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tamna Barat Sifre.

890
02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:14.590
Dan Khasis: dat piri vistina.

891
02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:16.270
Dan Khasis: range safe now.

892
02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:28.709
Dan Khasis: Yeah, it's not a problem, I agree. Parker, we could do it, get the money.

893
02:12:30.510 --> 02:12:31.929
Parker Woodward: Working on it. Will do.

894
02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:48.830
Parker Woodward: Just to… just so you also know the full spec on that, they're actually planning to run… I don't know how you want to call this, it's almost like a cascading optimization. So, on day one, they're gonna run an optimization for all of that.

895
02:12:48.830 --> 02:13:00.329
Parker Woodward: Let's say in an area, let's say 250 stops for a technician, and they know in this month they have to hit 250 stops, they're gonna run the planner with the white, listed days.

896
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:16.949
Parker Woodward: As well as all of the others. And then day 2, they're gonna know that that technician only made it to 10 of the stops out of 15. So now they're gonna rerun it with the same exact number of stops

897
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:25.670
Parker Woodward: And we'll obviously price them accordingly for all this, but they're gonna cascade it, meaning the next day two, they're gonna run the same optimization.

898
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:28.389
Parker Woodward: And insert the unrouted stops.

899
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:31.459
Dan Khasis: So… But they might also subtract the routed stops.

900
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:43.709
Parker Woodward: they're gonna subtract the routed stops, exactly, exactly. So it'll cascade, and a lot of computing power and optimization, but we'll charge them, you know, but it's…

901
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:49.960
Parker Woodward: really adaptive. Like, it's kind of handling the unrouted destinations automatically, which is…

902
02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:57.120
Dan Khasis: We could… we could put in, if we really wanted to, we could put in… Another rule that…

903
02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:06.749
Dan Khasis: another thing in the wizard. We could put in that if they're using a formal customer location, we could check our own customer location database.

904
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:12.879
Dan Khasis: And we could add another flag in the scenario wizard, and we could call that flag something like,

905
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:22.609
Dan Khasis: exclude… exclude customer locations routed in the last… or visited in the last N days. And so even if they upload 10,000,

906
02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:25.959
Dan Khasis: We would go to the customer locations database.

907
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:39.220
Dan Khasis: look at anything that had a note or visit in the last M days, and then wipe it out of the locations, and add another flag in the locations called, like, excluded… excluded reason. Visited in last…

908
02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:47.579
Dan Khasis: 20 days, or too far, or whatever. So we could auto-exclude certain things by certain rules, if we wanted to.

909
02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:53.850
Dan Khasis: That makes sense.

910
02:14:54.580 --> 02:15:12.370
Parker Woodward: It does to me. It's a future state, you know, roadmap, but it would be powerful to have the ability to say that we can route unrouted destinations, or sorry, unvisited destinations automatically. Call it… call it the AI rerouter or something.

911
02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:13.560
Dan Khasis: No, we…

912
02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:20.639
Dan Khasis: Routing on the visited is basically now going back to the customer list and saying, I want,

913
02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:28.019
Dan Khasis: just keep every day running a scenario, and every day the scenario that's running is every one I haven't visited.

914
02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:29.050
Parker Woodward: Yes.

915
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:35.479
Dan Khasis: But that's a… but anyway, we could… there's ways to do that. So, going back to our main thing, do you have…

916
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:42.119
Dan Khasis: Do you wanna… do you wanna take pictures right now of what… or do you know what,

917
02:15:43.570 --> 02:15:46.799
Dan Khasis: How it looks like, and what… what… do you have enough…

918
02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:52.799
Parker Woodward: The two items, it sounds like the week-to-week is resolved, and we're confident on that, correct me if.

919
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.760
Dan Khasis: We're not, I don't know if we're confident on that, but it is resolved.

920
02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:57.090
Parker Woodward: Okay, I'll.

921
02:15:57.090 --> 02:15:58.759
Dan Khasis: Or it's mostly resolved.

922
02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:01.050
Dan Khasis: Okay. Or it's possibly resolved.

923
02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:19.699
Parker Woodward: Okay, so I'll… I'll test as well, and then… but also, it sounds like, you know, if that looks good, I can enroll it to the pizza wholesalers. The second piece is the issues with the start times that were occurring, but that was, I believe, related to all the time zones.

924
02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:24.049
Dan Khasis: Yeah, well, that's not done yet. Do we know when that's gonna get done?

925
02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.570
Dan Khasis: Or not yet, Igor. Not yet.

926
02:16:27.570 --> 02:16:32.340
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Not yet, not yet. I think we will solve it today.

927
02:16:37.410 --> 02:16:40.059
Dan Khasis: Okay, what do we need to do with the,

928
02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:45.270
Dan Khasis: So, Parker, the map is coming soon.

929
02:16:45.379 --> 02:16:47.480
Dan Khasis: The map view is coming soon.

930
02:16:49.639 --> 02:16:54.299
Parker Woodward: That'll be very nice. The filters are… Awesome. So…

931
02:16:54.299 --> 02:16:57.249
Dan Khasis: Wait, could you think of any filters we might be missing?

932
02:16:58.459 --> 02:17:01.769
Parker Woodward: I haven't seen them yet, so, let me take a look.

933
02:17:29.759 --> 02:17:33.909
Parker Woodward: I don't see the filters on… they haven't been pushed to production.

934
02:17:34.170 --> 02:17:34.650
Dan Khasis: No.

935
02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:38.209
Parker Woodward: Alright, so I need to get,

936
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:45.780
Parker Woodward: access to a… an account. I don't have access to anything other than production, Dan.

937
02:17:46.770 --> 02:17:50.500
Dan Khasis: You don't… well, how come Parker doesn't have Route ML access? Does anyone know?

938
02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.209
Dan Khasis: If he's developing, have the stuff with us.

939
02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:04.110
Parker Woodward: I don't think anyone knows the answer, and the question, you know, I would ask is how quickly can you get me one?

940
02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:10.319
Dan Khasis: Well, it's 5 minutes, right? Artur can make it for you, probably.

941
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:13.690
Artur Moskalenko: Yep, I'll share credentials.

942
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:20.180
Parker Woodward: Thanks, Artur. I'll provide feedback on that, Dan, once I have those.

943
02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:25.850
Parker Woodward: But from what I saw, you know, it looked good. I mean, there's probably little things, but all good.

944
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:39.409
Dan Khasis: The density is where you should… the density and the delta between them is probably one of the bigger ones you should look at.

945
02:18:47.770 --> 02:18:49.390
Parker Woodward: Yeah, figuring out how to…

946
02:18:52.000 --> 02:19:00.330
Parker Woodward: figuring out how to display that routes are consistent week to week. Maybe it's even just a column. I'm just kind of going into thought, you know.

947
02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:04.819
Parker Woodward: solutions mode. Maybe it's even a column that we add that…

948
02:19:05.090 --> 02:19:08.150
Parker Woodward: Is there a percentage that are consistent week to week?

949
02:19:10.209 --> 02:19:12.379
Dan Khasis: Yeah, well, that's what I was showing right now.

950
02:19:12.839 --> 02:19:15.479
Dan Khasis: In the spreadsheet, which I was in a show right now.

951
02:19:16.609 --> 02:19:17.999
Dan Khasis: Give me a second.

952
02:19:37.379 --> 02:19:43.979
Dan Khasis: Okay, if every route, if you assume that…

953
02:19:47.019 --> 02:19:52.149
Dan Khasis: Every route has a… A bunch of destinations.

954
02:19:52.509 --> 02:19:55.639
Dan Khasis: And you assume that each destination has a checksum?

955
02:19:56.789 --> 02:19:59.099
Dan Khasis: Whatever that might be.

956
02:19:59.289 --> 02:20:04.869
Dan Khasis: plus some other attributes that are important to us. One could say that this is the route's checksum.

957
02:20:06.589 --> 02:20:12.919
Dan Khasis: So then, if you then have the exact same route, In the second week.

958
02:20:13.649 --> 02:20:16.619
Dan Khasis: And you assume that these val… these are…

959
02:20:18.539 --> 02:20:20.629
Dan Khasis: These values are equal to each other.

960
02:20:22.929 --> 02:20:29.609
Dan Khasis: Then the assumption would be that these two routes are…

961
02:20:29.839 --> 02:20:35.749
Dan Khasis: are equal to each other, because they have the same checksum. I'm using a math function to make it easier.

962
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:40.520
Vova: What if this destination is missing on next route?

963
02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:43.019
Dan Khasis: You're still… you're changing topics, but you're changing topics.

964
02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:44.520
Vova: basically the same.

965
02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:47.390
Dan Khasis: They're not… no, you're changing topics.

966
02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:51.959
Dan Khasis: This is a separate thing. First thing is exact match.

967
02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:56.949
Dan Khasis: you're going to partial match. The first thing is that most of the time.

968
02:20:58.090 --> 02:21:06.380
Dan Khasis: for scenario number one is exact match. You can't just… you can't just ignore that this is the exact match. Then you go into partial match.

969
02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:11.150
Dan Khasis: Exact match is easy to do, it's fast. Then you go to partial match.

970
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:19.630
Dan Khasis: The… the situation with partial match is that now you've got… This address and this address.

971
02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:23.590
Dan Khasis: We're okay in version 1s doing,

972
02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:34.250
Dan Khasis: what we call… comparison view, like I already told Sergey, that if the guy picks 3 addresses.

973
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:45.119
Dan Khasis: that, or excuse me, 3 routes that he would show on 3 columns, and all the metrics would be beneath them, so it'd be Route 1, Route 2, Route 3.

974
02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:56.090
Dan Khasis: And then all… the same as we have in the Legacy software, which I call Classic, not Legacy. Metrics A, B, C, D, Metrics Group.

975
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:01.969
Dan Khasis: That's it.

976
02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:08.660
Dan Khasis: And then you would show all the comparative metrics, and you would show the maps. The customers love it.

977
02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:13.370
Dan Khasis: When you see… that comparison view, they love it.

978
02:22:14.130 --> 02:22:17.129
Dan Khasis: With the map side-by-side and the metrics right below it.

979
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:22.640
Dan Khasis: That's, like, a big, big sales point for the customers.

980
02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:24.279
Parker Woodward: They do fucking love it.

981
02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:29.300
Dan Khasis: Because they're… otherwise, they have to open 50 fucking tabs.

982
02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:35.649
Dan Khasis: So anyway, so there… so this is your basic view, but then you're always saying, okay, what…

983
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:39.640
Dan Khasis: In week two… in week two, that's the expectation.

984
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:42.079
Dan Khasis: Then in week 2 for this customer.

985
02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:45.709
Dan Khasis: These stops are missing. That's exactly right.

986
02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:55.349
Dan Khasis: Or… And so now you're… you're… the thing is, is that… You switched now from a…

987
02:22:55.530 --> 02:22:58.860
Dan Khasis: Check some function, which is easy and fast to implement.

988
02:22:59.210 --> 02:23:02.519
Dan Khasis: To another function, where if each of these.

989
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:05.410
Vova: Bitmusks.

990
02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:12.590
Dan Khasis: Each of these routes, yeah, each of these, you have one array, or whatever, and then you have this one.

991
02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:21.910
Dan Khasis: And now you have keys, and if you look at the, I don't know, array keys, what's the, what's the intersection of the array keys of, of,

992
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:26.240
Dan Khasis: of array 1 and Array 2. And what you're gonna have is…

993
02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:34.369
Dan Khasis: it's gonna be… the intersection's gonna be these two are missing, or array diff, right, whatever that is for that language, array diff, so here it's gonna say…

994
02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:42.529
Dan Khasis: You had 10 here, and you had 8 here. It's gonna show you the delta.

995
02:23:43.330 --> 02:23:47.230
Dan Khasis: Is the 2, and so now this is 10 out of 10?

996
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:49.070
Vova: 80% match.

997
02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:53.619
Dan Khasis: Yeah, 10 out of 10, and this one's, 8 out of 10.

998
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:55.980
Dan Khasis: So then…

999
02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:11.469
Dan Khasis: And then over here, you… and then you got the delta, so this Route 2 matches Route 1, 80%. And then…

1000
02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:22.210
Dan Khasis: The objective, and then one of those histograms we talked about, we would show, like, okay, route… Consistency.

1001
02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:32.690
Dan Khasis: analysis, right? And then you would have 100% week-over-week match, or kind of is its own column. Then you go 90 to 99, then, let's say 80…

1002
02:24:33.470 --> 02:24:37.199
Dan Khasis: to 89. And so… and then you go down to…

1003
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:40.729
Dan Khasis: Whatever. All the way down to 0 to 10.

1004
02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:49.590
Dan Khasis: And then it would show, okay, well, in this case, we'd get a plus one for this range.

1005
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:55.919
Dan Khasis: In week one, we'd get… A plus 1 for this range.

1006
02:24:57.170 --> 02:25:01.809
Dan Khasis: And then, because we would have the checksums, The point would be.

1007
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.560
Dan Khasis: I don't know what's happening with this thing, it's just weird.

1008
02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:10.010
Dan Khasis: That's similar to how we have,

1009
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:14.170
Dan Khasis: The destination schedule, you would have the same for route schedule.

1010
02:25:14.310 --> 02:25:22.730
Dan Khasis: This customer would see Week 1, Week 2, And, Route 1…

1011
02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:27.550
Dan Khasis: And we… they would never match. That's the point. They would never match.

1012
02:25:28.310 --> 02:25:29.930
Dan Khasis: They don't want it to match.

1013
02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:35.720
Dan Khasis: But on week 3, They won a perfect match.

1014
02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:39.660
Dan Khasis: Which, which is what's gonna happen, it's gonna repeat.

1015
02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:51.870
Vova: And on week 4, they want a perfect match with week 2.

1016
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:54.510
Vova: In this case.

1017
02:25:54.510 --> 02:26:02.319
Dan Khasis: Exactly. And that's not what was happening. That's why we had to switch the algorithm. Because the algorithm kept moving shit around.

1018
02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:06.629
Dan Khasis: From week 1 to week 2. Week 3 was different.

1019
02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:12.059
Dan Khasis: So this would basically show, instead of a destinations list, it would show routes list.

1020
02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:17.260
Dan Khasis: It would still show destinations, it would still show… Locations.

1021
02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:23.500
Dan Khasis: It would still be broken down by… actually, it'd probably be…

1022
02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:32.839
Dan Khasis: by day of week, here would be the destination count. 20, 22, 23, but it's not the same route, right? A route is…

1023
02:26:33.730 --> 02:26:38.509
Dan Khasis: The week is the unique value of the week plus the day.

1024
02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:41.650
Dan Khasis: That's a unique route.

1025
02:26:42.610 --> 02:26:46.730
Dan Khasis: The route is not just the day, or just the week.

1026
02:26:51.370 --> 02:26:55.289
Vova: generally, I most likely shows a,

1027
02:26:55.570 --> 02:27:02.980
Vova: gonna want to, use the same drivers to visit the same customers, so they.

1028
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:03.500
Dan Khasis: For sure.

1029
02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:12.090
Vova: To assign, mostly, Similar routes to the same people.

1030
02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:19.000
Dan Khasis: Exactly, because these drivers are salespeople. They want the same people going the same route so they could sell more stuff.

1031
02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:25.269
Vova: Yeah, but sometimes, some destinations are gonna jump to other drivers because of optimization.

1032
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:29.500
Dan Khasis: Not in the consistency case. In the consistency case.

1033
02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:33.789
Dan Khasis: It doesn't jump to other drivers, which is why they like it.

1034
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:35.130
Vova: Sweet.

1035
02:27:35.130 --> 02:27:39.130
Parker Woodward: Not only doesn't it, it cannot. Operationally speaking.

1036
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:56.560
Parker Woodward: They have to send out a letter, a physical letter, to all of their customers to say, here's your driver that's changing. They care less about operational efficiency, as they are willing to sacrifice that efficiency in order to maintain the relationship efficiency.

1037
02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.339
Dan Khasis: That's what I'm saying, Tawa, that in this case, for this customer, is the same route.

1038
02:28:02.090 --> 02:28:09.850
Dan Khasis: there is no change. The difference is they had 10 on the first week, and they have 7 on the second week, and that's fine. They're gonna lose…

1039
02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:15.580
Dan Khasis: They're gonna lose that 30% efficiency, and they don't care. They're okay with it. Do it. They're fine with it.

1040
02:28:17.350 --> 02:28:18.459
Vova: No, it's clear.

1041
02:28:20.390 --> 02:28:24.210
Dan Khasis: The question is, how are we gonna check that the actual algorithm worked?

1042
02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:27.200
Dan Khasis: We… who's gonna tell us that answer?

1043
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:35.630
Dan Khasis: And… Igor, or who, or Parker, can we get Parker access to RouteML?

1044
02:28:36.390 --> 02:28:37.739
Parker Woodward: I have access now.

1045
02:28:37.940 --> 02:28:40.259
Dan Khasis: So can… maybe he could go in and look at it.

1046
02:28:43.350 --> 02:28:56.570
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Actually, we can… we can try to check it with Juan. Juan just confirmed that there is a problem with his request, and he's checking where is a problem, and I think we can…

1047
02:28:56.670 --> 02:29:00.659
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Check it, validate result, after fix.

1048
02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:03.969
Igor Skrynkovskyy: So… Or are we…

1049
02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:04.450
Dan Khasis: gigsaw.

1050
02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:08.659
Dan Khasis: Who takes the numbers math, you or Juan? Or them?

1051
02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:08.990
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Sorry.

1052
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.950
Dan Khasis: other API.

1053
02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:12.040
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Sorry?

1054
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.940
Dan Khasis: Who picks the math?

1055
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:19.570
Dan Khasis: For the, the visits, the total visits, who's doing that computation?

1056
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:26.900
Igor Skrynkovskyy: It's, it's making an API on our side, so it's after, optimization site.

1057
02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:32.410
Dan Khasis: But we don't know right now where the… why this… the math is broken, right?

1058
02:29:33.810 --> 02:29:44.860
Igor Skrynkovskyy: I think it's not a mass problem, it's a problem of optimization, because, it, solver generates too much, too many, stops, visits.

1059
02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:47.790
Dan Khasis: Oliver makes a bug?

1060
02:29:48.270 --> 02:29:53.539
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yes, yes, I think yes, but I need confirmation from Juan about this.

1061
02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:57.309
Dan Khasis: So, Parker, can you… you think you have enough?

1062
02:29:58.470 --> 02:30:04.039
Dan Khasis: to show Patrick that we added the route consistency thing, as well as the filters.

1063
02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:06.400
Dan Khasis: Yeah.

1064
02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:13.750
Parker Woodward: That's good, but… Am I hearing incorrectly that there's a bug with the wheat consistency?

1065
02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:20.210
Dan Khasis: No, there's a bug with something. I don't know if it's with consistency, it could be with that and 5 other things.

1066
02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:21.030
Parker Woodward: Okay.

1067
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:43.729
Igor Skrynkovskyy: We just need to confirm it, because it looks like on routes, we even saw on Dan's screen that, there was a similar route, yes, but somehow we have probably additional routes, or additional stops, to visit, I don't know, several times, or something.

1068
02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.200
Igor Skrynkovskyy: So, Juan will check, and we will reply.

1069
02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:49.200
Igor Skrynkovskyy: He will reply.

1070
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:51.870
Dan Khasis: Okay, Wish, so I have another question.

1071
02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:56.119
Dan Khasis: What's the story with that bloom net bug? We fixed it?

1072
02:30:57.940 --> 02:31:06.130
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yes, we have fixed it, but, let me check if we release it.

1073
02:31:07.850 --> 02:31:10.669
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Okay, it's, it's on staging.

1074
02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:17.439
Igor Skrynkovskyy: I see that those tickets are on staging, and Levan is testing them.

1075
02:31:20.770 --> 02:31:22.780
Igor Skrynkovskyy: I will push him now.

1076
02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:32.060
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yeah, it's just Kim.

1077
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:37.550
Kateryna Shevchenko: machine.

1078
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:39.310
Dan Khasis: Okay, Parker.

1079
02:31:39.970 --> 02:31:44.910
Dan Khasis: Well, do we have a picture to show… that you could send Parker, that he can send Patrick?

1080
02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:51.459
Dan Khasis: Of the map preview of how the new UI will look for the map preview?

1081
02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:55.660
Dan Khasis: Or the… When he… so he could see…

1082
02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:59.009
Dan Khasis: How he's gonna be able to explore the routes.

1083
02:31:59.010 --> 02:32:08.780
Vova: Yeah, sure. The weekly… One second, I'll show you right now, and send the picture to Parker directly.

1084
02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:15.190
Dan Khasis: And maybe, Parker, instead of showing it today, you could show it tomorrow. So it looks like we did something today, and we did something tomorrow.

1085
02:32:16.450 --> 02:32:17.730
Vova: Today you sent us…

1086
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:26.130
Vova: here.

1087
02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:34.359
Vova: you can see another tab. When you're looking at one scenario, you see another tab.

1088
02:32:34.650 --> 02:32:39.970
Vova: And this map shows you all routes within the same day.

1089
02:32:40.270 --> 02:32:42.790
Vova: And you can, scroll through days.

1090
02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:49.789
Vova: Using these small buttons on the sides, or you can pick dates here.

1091
02:32:49.970 --> 02:32:52.939
Vova: For each day, you see how much

1092
02:32:53.380 --> 02:33:03.290
Vova: Routes, and how much destinations are at that day. And you… for the day, you can see general stats of that day.

1093
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:18.840
Parker Woodward: This looks fucking awesome. This is where, too, you could also potentially have a consistency checker, or if somehow you could say, in the scenario, let me view

1094
02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:34.519
Parker Woodward: almost like a tabbed view, potentially? I don't know, Dan, I don't know if that's possible or too much, but, like, if you had the route A, for example, that's supposed to map to week 1 and Week 2, and you could kind of show that, or pull those…

1095
02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:44.819
Vova: what we can do… I, brainstorm right now. We can do… have a sidebar here that shows you, drivers.

1096
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:59.339
Vova: let's say, or… virtual drivers that are not yet assigned, but group… roads already grouped by those people. So these roads are meant to be traveling by the same person.

1097
02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.449
Parker Woodward: And you can…

1098
02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:14.470
Vova: Select this virtual driver, and filter this map by just that driver. And you can scroll and still see all routes for this driver on different days.

1099
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.770
Parker Woodward: Yeah.

1100
02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.059
Parker Woodward: I like that.

1101
02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:23.200
Vova: Then blue, like, this idea?

1102
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:28.760
Dan Khasis: The driver thing is complicated, we have to think how to do it.

1103
02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:32.079
Parker Woodward: Maybe not so much drivers, but if you can, like, group them, or the grouped.

1104
02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:36.930
Vova: Yes. Group… group of… groups of routes, name.

1105
02:34:36.930 --> 02:34:43.499
Dan Khasis: Before we do this, we need the comparison view. It's more… the comparison view is more powerful than the…

1106
02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:47.360
Dan Khasis: When you look at one route, unless you're gonna compare

1107
02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:54.540
Dan Khasis: the same route from 10 weeks, or 2 weeks, or 4 weeks, all on the same map, because you're showing

1108
02:34:54.850 --> 02:35:01.369
Dan Khasis: One specific day that's happening, which is great, but it's not the problem.

1109
02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:03.630
Dan Khasis: That they have, or that they need to solve.

1110
02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:06.970
Dan Khasis: Problem they need to solve is…

1111
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:11.999
Dan Khasis: I wanna look how every Monday from now to the next 6 weeks is gonna look.

1112
02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.020
Dan Khasis: It's gotta look the same.

1113
02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:16.519
Vova: I see.

1114
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.110
Dan Khasis: For the driver thing.

1115
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:22.360
Vova: Compare, the same day in different cycles.

1116
02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:24.349
Vova: For the same route.

1117
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:26.290
Dan Khasis: Yes.

1118
02:35:33.290 --> 02:35:36.730
Dan Khasis: That's why, Igor, we might… it might benefit us

1119
02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:41.009
Dan Khasis: To actually generate a real checksum.

1120
02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:42.549
Dan Khasis: Oh, the route.

1121
02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.959
Dan Khasis: And add it as a column for detailed analysis.

1122
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:50.720
Dan Khasis: We could use that farm fingerprint function, because it's fast.

1123
02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.410
Dan Khasis: That way, when Parker opens it with the guy, he could say, look, there's route ID.

1124
02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:03.430
Dan Khasis: This route checksum is exactly as this route checksum.

1125
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:06.950
Dan Khasis: And you could even use latitude, longitude, or…

1126
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:14.750
Dan Khasis: Some other way. Route IDs, it could be route destination ID, it could be… do you generate UUID, Igor?

1127
02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:19.139
Dan Khasis: For every single destination, in the order, in the route?

1128
02:36:19.350 --> 02:36:20.170
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yeah.

1129
02:36:21.210 --> 02:36:23.760
Dan Khasis: So it could be the hash of all the hashes.

1130
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:29.909
Dan Khasis: And then… It could be hidden by default.

1131
02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:34.249
Dan Khasis: It'd be an advanced color.

1132
02:36:34.970 --> 02:36:43.419
Dan Khasis: that Parker could open, so when the guy says, let's compare the routes, We'd be grouping by… By hash.

1133
02:36:44.190 --> 02:36:47.810
Dan Khasis: the route similarity, like the Levenstein distance.

1134
02:36:49.330 --> 02:36:50.440
Dan Khasis: type of thing.

1135
02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:59.500
Dan Khasis: Because it's basically fuzzy matching on a vector.

1136
02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:08.900
Igor Skrynkovskyy: Yeah, but, but we, we need to,

1137
02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:24.849
Igor Skrynkovskyy: to check only, full match, yes? So we… we don't, check the stops we… the stops which are not, in the same, sequence.

1138
02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:28.169
Igor Skrynkovskyy: And, stops.

1139
02:37:28.170 --> 02:37:31.899
Dan Khasis: The sequence doesn't matter, Parker. It just means that one route…

1140
02:37:31.970 --> 02:37:33.270
Parker Woodward: No, the same…

1141
02:37:33.390 --> 02:37:39.170
Dan Khasis: Yeah, the sequence doesn't matter. Now, for some customers, it might matter, But in that case…

1142
02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:42.190
Dan Khasis: We could change it… we could change the…

1143
02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:47.930
Dan Khasis: Igor, we could change the grouping function for similarity.

1144
02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:56.840
Dan Khasis: We could say similar by… Exact addresses, similar by exact addresses, exact sequence, with just extra checkboxes, similar by…

1145
02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.300
Dan Khasis: Exact sequence, exact address, exact customer.

1146
02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:03.419
Dan Khasis: And then let them pick. Why should we decide?

1147
02:38:11.810 --> 02:38:15.989
Dan Khasis: It would be like a route similarity or route consistency analysis.

1148
02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:27.580
Dan Khasis: Okay.

1149
02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:30.140
Dan Khasis: Anything else, Parker?

1150
02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:39.630
Parker Woodward: This is fucking amazing. And then…

1151
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:40.080
Igor Skrynkovskyy: -Oh.

1152
02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:42.470
Parker Woodward: The other thing, I know that the time…

1153
02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:46.840
Parker Woodward: Starts, time zone is a real pain, so appreciate all the work.

1154
02:38:47.250 --> 02:38:49.609
Parker Woodward: This looks… this is looking…

1155
02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:58.210
Parker Woodward: really good. I think it's gonna open a lot of fucking doors from us from a sales perspective, so I'm very excited about this.

1156
02:38:58.750 --> 02:39:02.690
Parker Woodward: This looks… I'm gonna, like, print this stuff out and, like…

1157
02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:07.889
Vova: I have one more thing to make you even more happier.

1158
02:39:11.890 --> 02:39:15.410
Dan Khasis: If you have a qualified lead, that's the only thing that doesn't make me happy.

1159
02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:28.129
Vova: This is a new concept for facility dashboard overview.

1160
02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:30.000
Parker Woodward: Oh, fuck.

1161
02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:42.940
Vova: It's meant to be… Customizable, so it has a huge set of different widgets.

1162
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:51.149
Vova: And you can pick a type of widget into which data you want to show this way.

1163
02:39:51.550 --> 02:40:00.480
Parker Woodward: one, this looks amazing. I know we're switching gears here a little bit, but maybe a question for Dan and team. Is there any way…

1164
02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:06.070
Parker Woodward: Why wouldn't we make facilities potentially a required field?

1165
02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:13.800
Dan Khasis: There's a lot of reasons.

1166
02:40:15.090 --> 02:40:17.970
Parker Woodward: Or opti- or optionally to make it required.

1167
02:40:18.390 --> 02:40:24.019
Parker Woodward: Meaning… I know that's difficult, and that's a very broad thing.

1168
02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:27.729
Dan Khasis: It's not difficult, but it's gonna piss off a lot of people who don't have…

1169
02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:32.489
Dan Khasis: Who don't own their own facilities, or have highly dynamic pickup airports.

1170
02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:45.310
Parker Woodward: I'm thinking, like, for example, Garda, as they go plan routes, I mean, we're gonna solve that through their IT, but, like, InReach right now, if someone plans a route, which they're relying on.

1171
02:40:45.470 --> 02:40:57.510
Parker Woodward: they're exporting from their source system, of truth, which is called Seed Cantaloupe, it's their, basically, order management system. They export the data, upload it into Route For Me, and plan routes from an upload.

1172
02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:13.880
Parker Woodward: If, at the account owner perspective, said, on uploads, require facility, or somehow in the parameters, they would require that facility. Otherwise, the reporting that starts to trickle up to facilities will be inconsistent.

1173
02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:23.270
Parker Woodward: Did that make sense?

1174
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:32.490
Dan Khasis: I think so.

1175
02:41:55.610 --> 02:41:59.699
Parker Woodward: Not to take away from how beautiful this is, Vova.

1176
02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:04.449
Dan Khasis: This is all… this is all experimental, none of this has been approved.

1177
02:42:04.450 --> 02:42:09.250
Vova: Yeah, yeah, we are just work in progress, and it is not finished yet.

1178
02:42:10.210 --> 02:42:12.200
Vova: Just the concept, for now.

1179
02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:21.669
Parker Woodward: I want to force people to use facilities, in other words.

1180
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:36.559
Vova: We're designing it this not just for facilities, it can be homepage, it can be on every snapshot, and everywhere.

1181
02:42:38.390 --> 02:42:41.290
Parker Woodward: Oh, sure. So, everywhere we can…

1182
02:42:41.290 --> 02:42:49.980
Vova: Should show analytical data, but we are not quite prepared to… Yet.

1183
02:42:51.450 --> 02:42:54.430
Vova: From database point of view, but…

1184
02:42:55.100 --> 02:42:58.390
Vova: At some point, I hope we will implement something like this.

1185
02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:06.769
Parker Woodward: This is probably an insane ask, but the ability to, like, build your own dashboard, similar to…

1186
02:43:06.890 --> 02:43:19.020
Parker Woodward: build your own BI tool, build your own dashboards. You know, if each one of these is modular, you could basically pull them into a dashboard that you drag and drop, but that's…

1187
02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:24.800
Parker Woodward: That's, brainstorming here a little bit, but I could see where that would be.

1188
02:43:24.990 --> 02:43:32.330
Parker Woodward: at least as a sales tool, very, very valuable, certainly from an operations perspective, I think, valuable as well, to give them what they want to see.

1189
02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:39.889
Parker Woodward: One thing you may want to consider in all this is even, like, things like the operational matrix. I think that's probably a…

1190
02:43:40.130 --> 02:43:45.360
Parker Woodward: under… Undervalued, piece of our platform.

1191
02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:48.289
Dan Khasis: Not done correctly, and we're waiting for them to redo it.

1192
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:52.149
Vova: And he is a new design for operational metrics.

1193
02:43:52.490 --> 02:43:56.380
Parker Woodward: I mean, to make this, like, front and center, like, personally, I think we should have…

1194
02:43:56.380 --> 02:44:01.439
Dan Khasis: This should be the default… this is the default… it's supposed to be the default.

1195
02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:04.859
Parker Woodward: Routes. Review, now the route, now the routes, yeah.

1196
02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:06.370
Parker Woodward: Yeah.

1197
02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:12.540
Parker Woodward: That's awesome.

1198
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:34.949
Parker Woodward: I'm like a kid in a candy store. This is awesome.

1199
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:39.240
Vova: We're working hard to… Make exciting scenes.

1200
02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:45.390
Dan Khasis: What's,

1201
02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:56.690
Dan Khasis: So, then the… Okay, what's next, on the, on the demo?

1202
02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:04.109
Vova: Do you want me to show more?

1203
02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:07.210
Dan Khasis: No, what's… what was the next program or update?

1204
02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:11.830
Dan Khasis: From the developers.

1205
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:17.180
Alexey Gusentsov: i, por…

1206
02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:38.680
Dan Khasis: Sergei… JSON file.

1207
02:45:40.970 --> 02:45:43.069
Dan Khasis: Strategic route planner?

1208
02:45:57.780 --> 02:46:01.700
Dan Khasis: cardiomatic, called, true water hematometonavir.

1209
02:46:02.890 --> 02:46:03.910
Serhii Kasainov: Not done yet.

1210
02:46:04.090 --> 02:46:05.529
Serhii Kasainov: Mutual slosh now.

1211
02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:09.469
Dan Khasis: Memorial scope still with that premise.

1212
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:11.970
Dan Khasis: La Grafica.

1213
02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:22.000
Dan Khasis: Da.

1214
02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:27.199
Dan Khasis: my mental… He had done in a shot.

1215
02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:54.499
Vova: journeys de la.

1216
02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:02.930
Serhii Kasainov: Back is Dylan.

1217
02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:25.730
Alexey Gusentsov: pirates.

1218
02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:31.040
Alexey Gusentsov: At Fermata speed odometer to the fuel level, battery level, so was last update.

1219
02:47:57.250 --> 02:48:00.240
Dan Khasis: Others did, they watch him boister, blister Italian.

1220
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:00.760
Alexey Gusentsov: 10 years now.

1221
02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:01.580
Dan Khasis: Sure.

1222
02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:02.930
Alexey Gusentsov: Hi, Yashna?

1223
02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:41.619
Dan Khasis: Was jestel tituda.

1224
02:48:42.580 --> 02:48:44.070
Serhii Kasainov: Cheetahist.

1225
02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:56.740
Vova: nis.

1226
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:10.320
Dan Khasis: cactus nause…

1227
02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:32.520
Dan Khasis: Yeah, no. Yeah, premium output motions delivered.

1228
02:49:34.640 --> 02:49:40.640
Davron Usmonov: no ovo.

1229
02:49:41.270 --> 02:49:43.449
Dan Khasis: I know at the Chicago.

1230
02:49:54.670 --> 02:49:55.450
Dan Khasis: Po…

1231
02:49:58.810 --> 02:50:00.949
Dan Khasis: So, Parker, that feature is…

1232
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:09.849
Dan Khasis: Shows, gives the user the ability to hover on the vehicle and see the last known info about the vehicle.

1233
02:50:11.850 --> 02:50:14.539
Dan Khasis: Okay, one second. So, if you pick a flight.

1234
02:50:15.930 --> 02:50:18.180
Dan Khasis: Pretend this is your vehicle tracking.

1235
02:50:23.470 --> 02:50:26.239
Parker Woodward: It's gonna tell you everything about the flight and the vehicle.

1236
02:50:26.820 --> 02:50:30.460
Dan Khasis: Well, the thing is, is that it was supposed to,

1237
02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:39.090
Dan Khasis: do you see how this… it loads a lot of flights, no problem, right? Our system's technically supposed to be as…

1238
02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:41.290
Dan Khasis: as efficient.

1239
02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:47.810
Dan Khasis: But… So here's a flight going from Naples to Chicago.

1240
02:50:48.310 --> 02:50:52.760
Dan Khasis: If you click route, they have a route too, and you see a speed and altitude graph?

1241
02:50:55.270 --> 02:50:57.910
Dan Khasis: Now, different sites show it a little differently.

1242
02:50:58.050 --> 02:51:02.670
Dan Khasis: So, you could open… You notice how you have a big, beautiful map?

1243
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:05.040
Dan Khasis: BBM.

1244
02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:08.100
Dan Khasis: You got a big, beautiful map.

1245
02:51:11.170 --> 02:51:12.480
Dan Khasis: And.

1246
02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:13.360
Parker Woodward: You did.

1247
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:17.099
Dan Khasis: Right here, you've got… if we had a vehicle.

1248
02:51:18.870 --> 02:51:22.139
Dan Khasis: You see, this is streaming, and we have the same thing.

1249
02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:31.529
Dan Khasis: And then, you could click on it, and it will give you that snapshot view of that particular

1250
02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:35.060
Dan Khasis: Plain.

1251
02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:43.480
Dan Khasis: Then, if you go on that plane, they're gonna… if you had a subscription, they would show you the routes and the other stuff, like…

1252
02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:47.310
Dan Khasis: Well, this site's a bit different, so…

1253
02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:55.929
Dan Khasis: Depending on the… here, this is gonna give you the snapshot. So this is the vehicle. In our case, it's a vehicle.

1254
02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:01.379
Dan Khasis: And it tells you, by day, this vehicle was on this route, this vehicle was on this route.

1255
02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:03.039
Dan Khasis: We don't have that.

1256
02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:05.209
Dan Khasis: We have to do a filter.

1257
02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:08.270
Dan Khasis: Buy vehicle in the routes list.

1258
02:52:10.260 --> 02:52:13.320
Dan Khasis: That's… so, like, if you click on a vehicle.

1259
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:18.230
Dan Khasis: You're supposed to see the routes list.

1260
02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.040
Dan Khasis: In the vehicle snapshot.

1261
02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:22.550
Alexey Gusentsov: It would exist.

1262
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:27.429
Vova: On design, it was from first day of the road snapshot.

1263
02:52:27.430 --> 02:52:28.630
Dan Khasis: So let… so…

1264
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:30.310
Vova: Of the vehicle assumption.

1265
02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:35.660
Dan Khasis: So, let's just say I had a vehicle, I'd click on it, it would show me.

1266
02:52:36.430 --> 02:52:37.969
Alexey Gusentsov: Yeah, I can show you. I can…

1267
02:52:37.970 --> 02:52:43.629
Dan Khasis: Yeah, show… one second. So, like, I'll… so, look, you see how… here it is, this is…

1268
02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:46.730
Dan Khasis: This is the flight right here.

1269
02:52:50.650 --> 02:52:51.570
Dan Khasis: And…

1270
02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:59.679
Dan Khasis: Usually what I… here it is, this is it. This is what we need in the route editor. If you enable that layer, or in the vehicle at the top.

1271
02:53:00.450 --> 02:53:01.949
Dan Khasis: You know, would show you.

1272
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:07.130
Dan Khasis: Like, this was the expected route altitude, this is the real one.

1273
02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:20.259
Dan Khasis: Or… because we have the plan, then we have the actual. You do the same thing with miles, you do the same thing with time, you do the same thing with service time, you do the same thing with weight, you do the same thing with pieces and cube.

1274
02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.930
Dan Khasis: And then you can make them compact, like sparklines.

1275
02:53:25.170 --> 02:53:26.819
Dan Khasis: So you could see them all.

1276
02:53:27.170 --> 02:53:41.559
Dan Khasis: You start the route full, you get to empty. That's in a drop-off route. You do pick up and drop-off, you start full, you go zero, you go up, you go down, you go up, you go down, you end… depending on your business, you end full, or maybe you end empty.

1277
02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:44.440
Dan Khasis: Yeah. That if it's just pickup, you leave empty?

1278
02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:48.250
Dan Khasis: Or you just keep going straight up?

1279
02:53:48.690 --> 02:53:52.959
Dan Khasis: And then you go to depot, back, you're empty. So depending on the business you're in.

1280
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:54.760
Dan Khasis: The graph will look different.

1281
02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:05.030
Vova: And we have this in designs for route snapshot.

1282
02:54:06.820 --> 02:54:07.750
Vova: Very wild.

1283
02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:11.440
Vova: I can share.

1284
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:31.230
Dan Khasis: If you… so… That's an example, that you guys will get the point.

1285
02:54:31.660 --> 02:54:37.009
Dan Khasis: We gotta keep going fast, because we've been on the call for a while. That's late for a lot of people.

1286
02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:41.429
Alexey Gusentsov: Yeah, so… I'm gonna continue.

1287
02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:47.049
Dan Khasis: Yes, you go back to that vehicle page, I want to show you something important.

1288
02:54:50.010 --> 02:54:57.499
Dan Khasis: ideally, this is where we have another API already. That API…

1289
02:54:59.970 --> 02:55:06.099
Dan Khasis: it shows you all of… it's called Get Asset Location, or Get Vehicle Location.

1290
02:55:06.610 --> 02:55:12.699
Dan Khasis: I was… Sergey knows about this one. It's supposed to show us… One more tab here.

1291
02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:16.750
Dan Khasis: For tracking, or telemetry, whatever we're gonna call it.

1292
02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.890
Dan Khasis: And they will show you List with hundreds or thousands of rows in it.

1293
02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:27.070
Dan Khasis: And it's gonna say… Date.

1294
02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:28.060
Dan Khasis: Time.

1295
02:55:28.200 --> 02:55:31.020
Dan Khasis: Speed, altitude, odometer.

1296
02:55:32.270 --> 02:55:34.600
Dan Khasis: Fuel level. Battery level.

1297
02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:40.170
Dan Khasis: And it's basically the tracking API with the history that we have.

1298
02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:46.049
Dan Khasis: is… that tracking API to the history that we have is supposed to…

1299
02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:52.340
Alexey Gusentsov: Show my very previous dates.

1300
02:55:52.670 --> 02:55:57.940
Dan Khasis: Show all the rows for all the data ever that's stored for that particular customer.

1301
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:09.410
Dan Khasis: Does that make sense?

1302
02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:11.570
Alexey Gusentsov: Yep.

1303
02:56:15.300 --> 02:56:25.170
Vova: And you can pick, one or few of these, metrics, and plot them.

1304
02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:28.509
Vova: On the same graph, or on different graphs.

1305
02:56:30.670 --> 02:56:32.250
Dan Khasis: That's later, but yes.

1306
02:56:32.410 --> 02:56:38.089
Dan Khasis: but then… or export them, if you want to analyze. The other problem with this UI right here.

1307
02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:41.980
Dan Khasis: Is that this entire section

1308
02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:48.730
Dan Khasis: is about latest status, but it doesn't make it look like it's the latest status. It just looks like…

1309
02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:56.729
Dan Khasis: whatever. You don't really know that it's the latest status, you have to add some sort of grouping there.

1310
02:57:01.470 --> 02:57:02.670
Vova: Understand?

1311
02:57:04.890 --> 02:57:07.790
Dan Khasis: You gotta add, like, a section category or something.

1312
02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:12.590
Vova: Yeah, a little miss.

1313
02:57:12.850 --> 02:57:13.630
Vova: Chem.

1314
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:19.660
Dan Khasis: And then.

1315
02:57:19.660 --> 02:57:22.390
Vova: and real-time status.

1316
02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:27.490
Dan Khasis: There's gonna be, at some point, related drivers or other stuff.

1317
02:57:29.950 --> 02:57:39.080
Vova: It meant… it should be here already. If this vehicle is on some road currently, and someone is driving it, it should show it.

1318
02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:40.700
Vova: Already, I believe.

1319
02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:43.319
Dan Khasis: It should. Yeah, it should.

1320
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:47.470
Dan Khasis: But I don't know if it does.

1321
02:57:54.060 --> 02:57:58.159
Dan Khasis: It might be nicer to output this stuff at the top, like the grid.

1322
02:57:58.530 --> 02:57:59.500
Dan Khasis: say…

1323
02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:07.670
Dan Khasis: Current speed, make it more like video game, right? Heads-up display, current speed, current odometer, current altitude, current fuel level.

1324
02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:09.820
Dan Khasis: Current battery level.

1325
02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:12.420
Dan Khasis: Current route.

1326
02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:21.530
Dan Khasis: I can share my screen and show a mockup already. By the way, the alignment is broken here. The alignment is broken here, too.

1327
02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:25.190
Alexey Gusentsov: Facility, yeah, it's no issue, it will be fixed soon, yep.

1328
02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.140
Alexey Gusentsov: About the same facility button?

1329
02:58:34.500 --> 02:58:41.059
Alexey Gusentsov: But just my question is, should we duplicate the information on the pop-up and left sidebar or dashboard?

1330
02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:48.440
Dan Khasis: The information on the left doesn't change, but the information here technically should change because of, polling or pusher.

1331
02:58:49.530 --> 02:59:02.269
Alexey Gusentsov: And but not… does it mean that all that stuff not should be real-time updated? You mean that only pop-ups should be real-time updated? And what about left sidebar?

1332
02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:07.830
Dan Khasis: I'm saying, I think we should do, if we're ready, if you guys already did most of the work.

1333
02:59:09.010 --> 02:59:13.580
Dan Khasis: Then we should probably…

1334
02:59:16.310 --> 02:59:23.399
Dan Khasis: Add… go to the next stage and add the stuff at the top, and then it would update every few… every 60 seconds at the top.

1335
02:59:25.310 --> 02:59:27.389
Dan Khasis: With, like, as expected.

1336
02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:32.159
Vova: Let me share my screen. I'll show the recap.

1337
02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:41.549
Dan Khasis: But… so what's the major update? That we're showing the vehicle facility, and then the map layers are coming next? So if you open the map, we'll see…

1338
02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:43.160
Dan Khasis: Other things?

1339
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:46.200
Alexey Gusentsov: Eventually?

1340
02:59:46.200 --> 02:59:47.620
Dan Khasis: For anyone, yeah.

1341
02:59:50.330 --> 02:59:51.400
Semeyon S: Basically.

1342
02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:53.089
Serhii Kasainov: Do you want it here?

1343
02:59:54.940 --> 02:59:59.929
Serhii Kasainov: We was planning to add the map as additional top.

1344
03:00:02.730 --> 03:00:10.640
Semeyon S: it must be the additional top for draft route snapshot. We didn't talk about vehicle snapshot.

1345
03:00:11.650 --> 03:00:21.849
Semeyon S: But basically, in the future… in the near future, all the maps must have all addition… our standard layers.

1346
03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:24.019
Dan Khasis: If you, if you open…

1347
03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:27.220
Semeyon S: Fullscreen mode.

1348
03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:40.989
Dan Khasis: If we open the… the thing is, if when you're looking at a vehicle, why would you look at a vehicle? I like for use cases.

1349
03:00:41.450 --> 03:00:44.670
Dan Khasis: It's being stolen. It broke down.

1350
03:00:45.210 --> 03:00:46.780
Dan Khasis: The guy's lost.

1351
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:48.969
Dan Khasis: He got sick.

1352
03:00:49.630 --> 03:00:52.740
Dan Khasis: And you need a replacement, and you gotta send the replacement?

1353
03:00:53.750 --> 03:01:02.000
Dan Khasis: You gotta finish… you gotta send the guy to get in the Uber to get to the truck, and drive the truck somewhere, because he's not feeling well, to finish the work.

1354
03:01:02.490 --> 03:01:04.460
Dan Khasis: You'd send a mechanic there?

1355
03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:06.200
Dan Khasis: To fix it.

1356
03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:08.729
Dan Khasis: You gotta tell a tow truck where it is?

1357
03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:13.700
Dan Khasis: That's why telematics is powerful, but it's not integrated with any workflow.

1358
03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:16.750
Dan Khasis: So now you know where the vehicle is, what are you gonna do about it?

1359
03:01:17.390 --> 03:01:24.080
Dan Khasis: Or you want to know what trips the vehicle's been on, so you've got the routes, but you also want to know what drivers have driven that vehicle.

1360
03:01:24.580 --> 03:01:30.500
Dan Khasis: You wanna know… Every time the vehicle got new gas.

1361
03:01:30.660 --> 03:01:36.020
Dan Khasis: Right? Because… how do you know the vehicle got gas? You got… because the fuel level went up?

1362
03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:40.410
Dan Khasis: Or because we integrated with a gas card.

1363
03:01:41.390 --> 03:01:44.600
Dan Khasis: System, and the gas card system told you.

1364
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:53.369
Dan Khasis: that… that, that this thing happened, though?

1365
03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:57.440
Dan Khasis: Right, the gas cart system tells you

1366
03:01:57.590 --> 03:02:04.219
Dan Khasis: That they… this vehicle got… this guy for this truck got… used this, got this gas.

1367
03:02:11.890 --> 03:02:23.869
Vova: We can compare how much gas he got, and the level of fuel in the tank, and understand if he's stolen this or not.

1368
03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:31.960
Dan Khasis: Exactly. That's the problem, that people are stealing gas, and no one knows if the route duration meets the…

1369
03:02:34.430 --> 03:02:35.710
Dan Khasis: All that stuff.

1370
03:02:38.190 --> 03:02:41.730
Parker Woodward: I have to drop for another call. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Lil. This looks great.

1371
03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:47.079
Dan Khasis: The trans cold? I… do you need me on that call? I think I was supposed to go on it, too.

1372
03:02:50.850 --> 03:02:51.360
Dan Khasis: Right?

1373
03:02:53.350 --> 03:02:56.170
Parker Woodward: Let me… I'll ping you if needed, Dan.

1374
03:02:58.120 --> 03:02:59.530
Parker Woodward: But yeah, I think…

1375
03:03:02.590 --> 03:03:04.590
Dan Khasis: Okay.

1376
03:03:16.490 --> 03:03:18.700
Alexey Gusentsov: Should I continue, or what else?

1377
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:24.430
Dan Khasis: Just know that when you're at the vehicle snapshot, the… the…

1378
03:03:25.250 --> 03:03:27.360
Dan Khasis: That our job is to get…

1379
03:03:28.380 --> 03:03:31.639
Dan Khasis: It's to show as much convenient information as possible.

1380
03:03:35.930 --> 03:03:37.849
Dan Khasis: That's the ju- that's her job.

1381
03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:43.539
Alexey Gusentsov: Yeah, so for now, we are showing all we have from the telemetrics.

1382
03:03:43.890 --> 03:03:44.750
Alexey Gusentsov: Commodities.

1383
03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:57.240
Alexey Gusentsov: And so, the main reason of this task is that this pop-up will be consistent in the route editor and the vehicles page, so…

1384
03:03:57.780 --> 03:04:02.930
Alexey Gusentsov: That's all from this… task, both apart, and yeah.

1385
03:04:02.930 --> 03:04:07.770
Dan Khasis: I feel like we're very close, but I feel like something's missing. Like, for example…

1386
03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:11.039
Dan Khasis: The main screen should maybe be…

1387
03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:17.569
Dan Khasis: Similar to Business Insights, which shows you, like, routes per day for the last day, or…

1388
03:04:18.330 --> 03:04:20.520
Dan Khasis: A calendar view, or…

1389
03:04:20.700 --> 03:04:29.330
Dan Khasis: the last… the mileage that accumulated, or something. I feel like just going straight to the transaction list of routes.

1390
03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:35.859
Dan Khasis: is okay for version 1, but it's not useful for business people. It's useful only for…

1391
03:04:36.730 --> 03:04:50.820
Dan Khasis: the random guy who's, like, the operator, but the world is bigger than just… the people who write the checks are not the operators.

1392
03:04:53.320 --> 03:05:01.439
Dan Khasis: La premier… No, with Zakazi, no with Tasco.

1393
03:05:19.230 --> 03:05:25.310
Dan Khasis: voila.

1394
03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:51.980
Vova: primasicios.

1395
03:05:51.980 --> 03:05:55.339
Dan Khasis: You can… you can hear some operational issues, though.

1396
03:06:21.150 --> 03:06:28.830
Dan Khasis: Magdala, but the worst, shaw's, siasa teneto.

1397
03:06:29.530 --> 03:06:32.500
Alexey Gusentsov: snapshot.

1398
03:06:56.810 --> 03:06:57.910
Alexey Gusentsov: Don Dutch, then?

1399
03:07:01.570 --> 03:07:04.310
Dan Khasis: 0% of the update of my Pacrely.

1400
03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:10.919
Alexey Gusentsov: Yani ponado cross.

1401
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:12.470
Semeyon S: Scope.

1402
03:07:12.470 --> 03:07:16.429
Dan Khasis: update of Astalis, Astalgia.

1403
03:07:42.510 --> 03:07:43.350
Alexey Afanasiev: conditioner.

1404
03:07:43.480 --> 03:07:44.889
Davron Usmonov: Pretty shitty smooth.

1405
03:08:02.370 --> 03:08:03.400
Alexey Afanasiev: Distant.

1406
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:04.750
Alexey Afanasiev: Isa nomination.

1407
03:08:04.750 --> 03:08:06.210
Dan Khasis: Design Romano.

1408
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:10.460
Alexey Gusentsov: Hmm?

1409
03:08:17.290 --> 03:08:19.400
Artur Moskalenko: Principitator.

1410
03:08:20.590 --> 03:08:21.860
Alexey Gusentsov: No, please.

1411
03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:40.880
Alexey Gusentsov: routes, destinations, orders, custom relocations.

1412
03:08:41.060 --> 03:08:43.250
Alexey Gusentsov: Is Chinese users obstinate?

1413
03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:45.539
Alexey Gusentsov: what E.

1414
03:08:55.530 --> 03:08:59.699
Dan Khasis: Their customers. Was your customer locations, like, the customers?

1415
03:09:01.130 --> 03:09:10.480
Dan Khasis: customer locations grouped by customer.

1416
03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:13.730
Alexey Gusentsov: So divine customer.

1417
03:09:15.330 --> 03:09:18.850
Dan Khasis: In vehicles.

1418
03:09:21.470 --> 03:09:23.790
Vova: madak.

1419
03:09:29.380 --> 03:09:31.570
Alexey Gusentsov: Sprim.

1420
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:59.650
Igor S.: Mine is a concier level.

1421
03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:13.720
Dan Khasis: Tavra Proster, Samur…

1422
03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:19.230
Dan Khasis: Samo alimentarna.

1423
03:10:19.230 --> 03:10:19.860
Igor S.: And.

1424
03:10:19.860 --> 03:10:21.290
Dan Khasis: a David-only regime.

1425
03:10:21.290 --> 03:10:21.879
Igor S.: What the…

1426
03:10:28.890 --> 03:10:37.269
Dan Khasis: Yeah, yeah, see.

1427
03:10:45.150 --> 03:10:48.760
Igor S.: No, da.

1428
03:11:13.210 --> 03:11:20.669
Dan Khasis: Okay, kundo.

1429
03:11:21.930 --> 03:11:34.110
Dan Khasis: Well, that, bad… with that unify UI pad? There's just your sites at the facilities, metrics, esta polo.

1430
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:36.050
Dan Khasis: interiors.

1431
03:11:37.850 --> 03:11:45.430
Dan Khasis: society views, would that the default views? Facility? Would that the pre-border no facility?

1432
03:11:51.250 --> 03:12:00.930
Dan Khasis: epo tom… critical net uptime.

1433
03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:19.220
Dan Khasis: Yeah, but Tom… aktivina, Internet.

1434
03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:22.400
Dan Khasis: A wire is sort of per click on the side.

1435
03:12:33.050 --> 03:12:54.160
Dan Khasis: a management… il… Premier's TPR communicates, we're strong with the Premier Demotion with routing.

1436
03:12:54.630 --> 03:13:02.940
Dan Khasis: strategic routing.

1437
03:13:05.050 --> 03:13:11.140
Dan Khasis: Nice security. Security deperies Novovesh, turns away, it's a sensor.

1438
03:13:12.230 --> 03:13:18.780
Dan Khasis: Provne.

1439
03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:35.680
Dan Khasis: Wirsch.

1440
03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:37.659
Dan Khasis: Is this Razelier.

1441
03:13:38.580 --> 03:13:40.240
Dan Khasis: Raza temperatura.

1442
03:13:41.180 --> 03:13:49.140
Dan Khasis: to bid… And ideally it's called cosveta.

1443
03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:57.749
Dan Khasis: It's called Kedigenia, chimona connected.

1444
03:14:03.970 --> 03:14:07.089
Vova: with machini, surrounding with mashruti.

1445
03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:11.650
Vova: -Oh.

1446
03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:20.169
Vova: property at the entity in the categorized moderation.

1447
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:51.379
Dan Khasis: Although… what the odd grill…

1448
