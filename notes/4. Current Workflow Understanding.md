## Current Workflow Understanding

```
Video (MP4) 
    ↓
TurboScribe (you upload manually)
    ↓
Resegmented text file (you control granularity)
    ↓ 
Your system (Whisper + GPT extraction)
```

**Key facts:**

- TurboScribe does its own transcription + speaker diarization
- You control resegmentation settings in TurboScribe
- Normal meetings: 3-4 hours
- Test file: 30 minutes
- Need to find optimal resegmentation strategy

## Critical Questions Before I Can Help

### Q1: What format does TurboScribe export?

Options:

- A) Plain text with timestamps like: `(2:56 - 3:15) Speaker Name: text here`
- B) SRT format (subtitle format)
- C) VTT format (WebVTT)
- D) JSON with speaker + timestamps
- E) Something else?

**Action**: Export the 30min file in ALL available formats and show me

### Q2: Does TurboScribe label speakers?

- A) Yes, automatically (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
- B) Yes, you can name them manually (Dan Khasis, Vova, etc.)
- C) No, just continuous text

**Action**: Show me a sample segment with speaker labels

### Q3: What resegmentation controls does TurboScribe have?

- By sentence?
- By time duration (e.g., every 30 seconds)?
- By speaker change?
- By paragraph/topic?
- By word count?

**Action**: List all available resegmentation options

## Edge Cases You Should Test

Create **5 different exports** from the same 30-min video:

### Test File 1: **Ultra-Fine Segmentation**

- Segment by: Sentence or every 10-15 seconds
- Purpose: Test if very short segments cause problems
- Expected: Many segments (500+ for 30 min)

### Test File 2: **Ultra-Coarse Segmentation**

- Segment by: Paragraph or every 2-3 minutes
- Purpose: Test if long segments lose speaker changes
- Expected: Few segments (~10-15 for 30 min)

### Test File 3: **Speaker-Change Segmentation**

- Segment by: Every time speaker changes
- Purpose: Test ideal case for speaker alignment
- Expected: Natural number of segments based on conversation flow

### Test File 4: **Time-Based Segmentation (30 seconds)**

- Segment by: Fixed 30-second intervals
- Purpose: Test regular chunking with mid-sentence cuts
- Expected: ~60 segments for 30 min

### Test File 5: **Time-Based Segmentation (90 seconds)**

- Segment by: Fixed 90-second intervals
- Purpose: Test if longer fixed segments work better
- Expected: ~20 segments for 30 min

## What I Need From Each Test File

For each of the 5 test files above, provide:

1. **The actual exported file** (whatever format TurboScribe gives you)
2. **Segment count** (how many segments in the file)
3. **Sample of first 5 segments** (so I can see the format)
4. **Sample from middle** (segments around 15-min mark)
5. **Sample from end** (last 5 segments)

## Additional Information Needed

### About the meetings:

- **Average speakers per meeting**: ? (you mentioned 10-15?)

- **Language mix**: Russian + English? (you mentioned mixed)

- Speaker patterns

  :

  - One person dominates (like 50% of time)?
  - Equal participation?
  - Rapid back-and-forth discussions?

### About TurboScribe output:

- **Does it include confidence scores?**
- **Does it mark language per segment?** (RU vs EN)
- **Does it handle overlapping speech?** (two people talking at once)
- **Does it mark hesitations/filler words?** (um, uh, etc.)

## What I'll Do With This Data

Once you provide the 5 test files, I'll:

1. **Analyze segment distribution** - see which resegmentation works best
2. **Check speaker accuracy** - verify speakers are correctly preserved
3. **Test alignment algorithms** - find optimal matching strategy
4. **Identify failure modes** - what breaks and why
5. **Recommend optimal settings** - what resegmentation to use for 3-4 hour meetings

## Expected Format Example

If you're using the text format like in your earlier file, show me:

```
# Test File 3 (Speaker-Change Segmentation)
Segment count: 87
Format: Plain text with timestamps

=== FIRST 5 SEGMENTS ===
(0:05 - 0:18)
Dan Khasis: Hello everyone, let's get started with today's standup.

(0:18 - 0:35)
Vova: Great, I want to start. I've been working on the snapshot functionality.

...

=== MIDDLE (around 15:00) ===
(15:02 - 15:28)
Igor: I think we should reconsider the approach...

...

=== LAST 5 SEGMENTS ===
(29:15 - 29:45)
Dan: Alright, thank you everyone. See you tomorrow.
```

## Critical Questions for 3-4 Hour Meetings

Since your real meetings are much longer:

1. **Does TurboScribe have a segment limit?** (e.g., max 1000 segments?)
2. **Does it handle multi-hour processing well?**
3. **Can you batch-process multiple files?**
4. **What's the cost per hour of transcription?**

## What NOT to Do Yet

- ❌ Don't process all 25 meetings yet
- ❌ Don't worry about Whisper (we may not need it anymore)
- ❌ Don't worry about VTT alignment (no longer relevant)
- ❌ Don't generate any code yet

## What TO Do Now

✅ Export the 30-min test file in 5 different resegmentation modes ✅ Show me the format and samples from each ✅ Answer the questions above about TurboScribe capabilities ✅ Tell me about typical meeting characteristics (speakers, patterns, etc.)

Once I see the actual TurboScribe output format and test the 5 segmentation strategies, I can build the optimal pipeline for your 25 meetings.

**Show me the data first, then we'll build the solution.**
