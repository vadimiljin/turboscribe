# What result I need for NotebookLM

For each of 3+4 hour video transcripts, I need 

transcript.md (conversation + RICH intelligence - everything combined - very compact but readable)

- Full conversation with timestamps ✓
- Participant list with segment counts ✓
- Executive summary ✓
- **Detailed decisions** (quotes, confidence, timestamps) ⭐ NEW
- **Detailed action items** (owners, deadlines, quotes) ⭐ NEW
- **Detailed risks** (grouped by severity, mitigation) ⭐ NEW
- **Open questions** (with quotes) ⭐ NEW
- **Technical terminology** (definitions, frequency) ⭐ NEW

It must be better that SUMMARY made with gemini LLM and by hand by Alexey after every meeting, which used ugly broken transcripts. It must be really useful for software development and knowledge collection.
